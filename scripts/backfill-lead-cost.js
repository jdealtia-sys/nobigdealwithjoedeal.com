 * scripts/backfill-lead-cost.js
 *
 * ONE-TIME BACKFILL — stamps `leadCost` (dollars) on every /leads doc whose
 * `notes` already contain the acquisition fee as free text.
 *
 * Background
 * ──────────
 * The Thumbtack ingest has been writing the fee into the notes blob since the
 * integration went in:
 *
 *     Thumbtack — Roof Repair or Maintenance
 *     I need this wooden part replaced. The grade of the roof …
 *     Lead cost: $51.96
 *     · Travel Preferences: The roofer travels to me
 *
 * So the number every ROI question needs has been in Firestore all along — as
 * a line of prose, which nothing can sum, chart, or subtract from a job. The
 * September 2026 lead audit had to be rebuilt by hand from the Thumbtack
 * payment ledger for exactly this reason.
 *
 * This backfill parses that line into a real numeric field so
 * lead-source-roi.js can divide by it.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
 * ───────────────────
 * Refunds are NOT in the notes — Thumbtack refunds a lead after the fact and
 * never rewrites the message. So this stamps the GROSS charge. Eight leads in
 * the Jul 31 – Sep 6 2026 window were refunded and need leadCost set to 0 by
 * hand afterwards; the script prints them as a checklist when it finishes.
 * Deliberately manual: matching a refund to a doc by customer name is exactly
 * the kind of fuzzy join that silently zeroes the wrong record.
 *
 * SAFETY
 *   • Dry-run by default — prints what WOULD change, writes nothing.
 *   • --apply requires --yes as well.
 *   • Idempotent — skips any doc that already carries a numeric leadCost > 0.
 *     Only ever FILLS a gap; a hand-entered value is authoritative and is
 *     never overwritten. Safe to re-run.
 *   • A doc with no parseable "Lead cost:" line is left completely alone —
 *     null and 0 mean different things here (10 of 85 leads in the audit
 *     window were genuinely free), so this never writes a speculative zero.
 *   • Also stamps leadCostSource:'notes-backfill' so a parsed value stays
 *     distinguishable from one a human typed into the Lead Cost field.
 *
 * SETUP (per the admin-script-runner pattern — prod nobigdeal-pro via ADC).
 *   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/.nbd/nobigdeal-pro-sa.json
 *   export NBD_PROJECT=nobigdeal-pro               # optional override
 *
 * RUN
 *   node scripts/backfill-lead-cost.js               # dry-run
 *   node scripts/backfill-lead-cost.js --apply --yes # actually write

// FIVE OF THESE CANNOT MATCH A LEAD, AND THAT IS CORRECT — do not "fix" it.
// /thumbtack_leads (the raw ingest) starts 2026-08-16, but this window opens
// 2026-07-31, so Daulton, Evans, Simms, Madison and Terry Greene were billed
// before the integration existed and were never going to be in Firestore.
// They were worked manually and have Drive folders. Investigated and closed
// 2026-09-06; scripts/audit-refund-provenance.js reproduces the finding.
//
// Terry Greene is the one to be careful with: the only "Greene" in the CRM is
// MICHAEL Greene, a different customer. A surname join zeroes the wrong record.
//
// scripts/apply-lead-cost-refunds.js applies this list under a unique-name AND
// exact-amount AND ingest-prefix guard, and skips loudly rather than guessing.
