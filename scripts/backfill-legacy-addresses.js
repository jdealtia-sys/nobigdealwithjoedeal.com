/**
 * scripts/backfill-legacy-addresses.js
 *
 * ONE-TIME REPAIR — replaces pre-Wave-141 mangled `address` strings on
 * /leads with verified correct addresses.
 *
 * Background
 * ──────────
 * Before Wave 141 the address autocomplete stored
 * `display_name.split(',').slice(0,3)`, producing "1054, Klondyke Road,
 * Goshen" — comma after the house number, unabbreviated road, no state, no
 * ZIP, and a Nominatim hamlet/subdivision where the post town belongs.
 * dashboard-ui.js formatMailingAddress() fixed the write path; the rows
 * written before the cutover still hold the mangled strings and every
 * document generated off them is mis-addressed.
 *
 * Run `node scripts/audit-lead-addresses.js --list` first — it reports the
 * full damage and is the acceptance test for this script.
 *
 * WHY A HARDCODED MAP AND NOT RE-GEOCODING
 * ────────────────────────────────────────
 * Re-geocoding a mangled string returns whatever Nominatim thinks
 * "7003, Greenstone Trace, O'Bannon Creek" means — which is how the row
 * broke in the first place. Every correction below is transcribed from a
 * finished NBD document (invoice, estimate, photo report) where Joe wrote
 * the address himself. Nothing here is inferred. A row with no verified
 * source is REPORTED, never guessed at.
 *
 * SAFETY
 *   • Dry-run by default; --apply requires --yes.
 *   • Verify-before-write: a row is only touched when its CURRENT value is
 *     byte-identical to `expectCurrent`. If someone has already corrected
 *     it by hand, the entry no-ops instead of overwriting their work.
 *   • Idempotent — re-running after a successful apply reports "already
 *     correct" and writes nothing.
 *   • Only ever writes `address` (+ `updatedAt`). No other field is touched.
 *
 * SETUP (admin-script-runner pattern — prod nobigdeal-pro via ADC).
 * firebase-admin arrives through scripts/_admin.js, which resolves it out of
 * functions/node_modules — scripts/ and the repo root have none of their own.
 * Do NOT set NODE_PATH: _admin tries a bare require.resolve FIRST, so a
 * NODE_PATH install satisfies it and silently decides which firebase-admin
 * this script gets, which is the single-resolver guarantee _admin exists to
 * provide. Runs on v12 and v14 alike.
 *
 * (This docstring used to warn "v14 breaks Timestamps". That was inherited
 * boilerplate — it appeared verbatim in seven sibling scripts, the exact
 * copy-paste propagation _admin.js's own docstring describes. This script
 * READS only `address`, `firstName` and `lastName`, all strings, and orders by
 * the '__name__' string literal — no Timestamp is ever read, compared or
 * printed. The only one it produces is `updatedAt: new Date()`, a JS Date the
 * Firestore serializer converts identically on v12 and v14. See
 * documentation/audit/ADMIN-SCRIPTS-ADMIN-PORT-2026-09-01.md.)

/**
 * Verified corrections. `expectCurrent` is the mangled value as it stands in
 * Firestore today — the write only happens on an exact match.
 *
 * Two sources are accepted, and nothing else:
 *
 *  1. A DOCUMENT: something in Drive/NBD/CUSTOMERS/<customer>/ where the
 *     address is written out properly. Hand-listed below.
 *
 *  2. A RE-GEOCODE: scripts/legacy-address-corrections.json holds the
 *     pre-Wave-141 strings put back through Nominatim and formatted by the
 *     shipped formatMailingAddress() — i.e. the fixed write path re-run over
 *     the old data. Every row there cleared three guards before being
 *     written down: the house number is unchanged, the first token of the
 *     street name is unchanged, and the result lands in OH/KY/IN. A row that
 *     failed any guard is NOT in the file (e.g. "123, Franklin Township,
 *     Franklin County" geocoded to Phillips, Maine — rejected, still
 *     reported by the audit).
 *
 * `expectCurrent` still gates every write, so a record edited by hand since
 * the audit is skipped rather than overwritten.
