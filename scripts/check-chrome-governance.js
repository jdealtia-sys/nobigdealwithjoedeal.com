/**
 * check-chrome-governance.js — every marketing page's nav and footer must be
 * generator-owned, or explicitly and briefly excused here.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * apply-partials.js skips any file that carries no `nbd:partial` marker. That
 * is correct behaviour for a restamper, but it means a page with hand-built
 * chrome is invisible to `--check` — and therefore to CI — forever. 22 of 211
 * marketing pages were in that state, including the homepage.
 *
 * The consequence is not hypothetical. Every sitewide chrome sweep since
 * 2026-06 (the cert-bar rollout, the American Operator badge, the WCAG contrast
 * fix, the privacy-link injection) reached the partial-stamped pages and
 * stopped at exactly this boundary, leaving residue on the same ~29 files each
 * time. The 2026-08-19 audit found all of it downstream of this one gap.
 *
 * SELECTION IS A WALK, NOT A LIST. Three guards in this repo have now failed
 * because the offending file was on neither their strict list nor their
 * exception list (ensure-icon-css 2026-08-17, catalog-cost-privacy 2026-08-18,
 * marketing-polish-contract's certBarTargets 2026-08-19). So this walks the
 * tree and treats EXEMPT as a denylist of known-good: a NEW page defaults to
 * failing, which is the inversion those three got backwards.
 *
 * EXEMPT entries carry a reason and are themselves checked — an entry that no
 * longer needs to be there is a failure too, so the list shrinks as the
 * follow-ups land instead of quietly rotting.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-chrome-governance.js
 *   node scripts/check-chrome-governance.js --json
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 clean / 1 violations / 2 fatal.
