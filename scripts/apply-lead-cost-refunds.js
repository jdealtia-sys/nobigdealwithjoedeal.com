/**
 * scripts/apply-lead-cost-refunds.js
 *
 * Zeroes `leadCost` on the leads Thumbtack refunded, and records that it was a
 * refund rather than a free lead.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE SCRIPT
 * ─────────────────────────────
 * backfill-lead-cost.js stamps the GROSS charge, because that is what the
 * notes blob carries — Thumbtack refunds a lead after the fact and never
 * rewrites the message. It prints the refunds as a checklist and refuses to
 * apply them, on the reasoning that matching a refund to a doc by customer
 * name is the kind of fuzzy join that silently zeroes the wrong record.
 *
 * That reasoning is right about the danger and wrong about the conclusion: a
 * fuzzy join is unsafe, but a join that REFUSES TO GUESS is not. This applies
 * the same list under three conditions, and skips loudly if any of them fails:
 *
 *   1. Exactly ONE lead in this company matches the name. Zero or two → skip.
 *   2. That lead's stored leadCost equals the refunded amount to the cent.
 *      A mismatch means the name matched the wrong record, or the gross was
 *      never stamped — either way, do not touch it.
 *   3. The doc carries the `thumbtack_leads__` ingest prefix. A refund only
 *      exists for a lead Thumbtack actually billed.
 *
 * Skipping is the safe outcome and is always reported. Nothing is inferred.
 *
 * WHY IT MATTERS
 * ──────────────
 * The eight refunds total more than the whole $1,010.96 the backfill stamped.
 * Leaving the gross in place does not make cost-per-lead slightly wrong — it
 * makes it wrong by more than 100%, which is worse than having no number,
 * because a wrong number gets trusted.
 *
 * `leadCost: 0` alone would be a lie of a different kind — it reads identical
 * to a genuinely free lead, and the backfill is careful to keep those
 * distinct. So this also writes `leadCostRefunded: true` and the original
 * gross in `leadCostGross`, and marks `leadCostSource:'refund-applied'`.
 * Nothing is destroyed; the refund is recorded as an event, not an erasure.
 *
 * SAFETY
 *   • Dry-run by default. --apply requires --yes as well.
 *   • --company is REQUIRED. /leads is multi-tenant — see
 *     scripts/normalize-lead-source.js for what an unscoped write nearly did.
 *   • Idempotent — a doc already carrying leadCostRefunded is skipped.
 *
 * RUN  (NBD's own companyId is 1phDvAVXHSg82wDLegAbQFq14Ci1)
 *   node scripts/apply-lead-cost-refunds.js --company=<id>
 *   node scripts/apply-lead-cost-refunds.js --company=<id> --apply --yes
