/**
 * scripts/audit-imported-docs-placement.js — READ ONLY. Writes nothing.
 *
 * "Is it in the right folder" has two halves, and checking only one is how a
 * document ends up filed against the wrong customer:
 *
 *   Drive  — is the PDF under <Customer>/Docs ?   (the importer only ever
 *            reads Docs/ and Reports/, so anything it imported was in one)
 *   CRM    — is the documents row on THAT customer's lead ?
 *
 * This checks the CRM half. Every drive_import row is matched to its lead by
 * NAME **or by STREET ADDRESS**, because NBD's measurement reports are named
 * by address, not by customer — "Full Report - 1004 River Forest Dr…" belongs
 * to David Wolfe and a name-only check calls that a mismatch. A first pass
 * flagged 26 such files; every one was correctly placed. Only a file matching
 * neither the lead's name nor its address is a real suspect.
 *
 * RUN
 *   node scripts/audit-imported-docs-placement.js --company=<id>
