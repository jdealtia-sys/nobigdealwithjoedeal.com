# Post-Deploy Checklist — NBD Pro Security Fixes

Ship this checklist end-to-end on the day of deploy. Do not merge to `main` until every box is checked.

## 1. Pre-deploy

- [ ] Read `SECURITY_BATTLE_PLAN.md` end to end.
- [ ] Read `SECRET_ROTATION.md` and rotate every secret listed there.
- [ ] `cd functions && npm install` (picks up any new dependencies).
- [ ] `cd tests && npm install && npm test` — firestore rules unit tests must pass. Do NOT deploy if they fail.

## 2. Grant yourself (Joe) the admin custom claim

Admin access is no longer a Firestore field. It is a custom claim set via the Admin SDK. Run this ONCE from your dev machine (needs a service-account key):

```bash
node -e "
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
admin.initializeApp({ credential: admin.credential.applicationDefault() });
(async () => {
  const user = await admin.auth().getUserByEmail('jd@nobigdealwithjoedeal.com');
  await admin.auth().setCustomUserClaims(user.uid, { role: 'admin' });
  console.log('admin claim set for', user.uid);
  process.exit(0);
})();
"
```

Then sign out and back in on `admin/login.html` to pick up the claim.

## 3. Seed `access_codes` in Firestore

The hardcoded access code list in the old `validateAccessCode` is gone. The new function reads codes from the `access_codes` collection. Bootstrap the ones you want to keep:

```bash
node -e "
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
admin.initializeApp({ credential: admin.credential.applicationDefault() });
const db = admin.firestore();
const codes = {
  'NBD-DEMO':  { active: true, email: 'demo@nobigdeal.pro', role: 'member', plan: 'foundation', trialDays: 14,  displayName: 'Demo User' },
  'DEMO':      { active: true, email: 'demo@nobigdeal.pro', role: 'member', plan: 'foundation', trialDays: 14,  displayName: 'Demo User' },
  'NBD-2026':  { active: true, email: 'invite.2026@nobigdeal.pro', role: 'member', plan: 'foundation', trialDays: 90, displayName: 'Beta Member' },
  'ROOFCON26': { active: true, email: 'invite.2026@nobigdeal.pro', role: 'member', plan: 'foundation', trialDays: 90, displayName: 'Beta Member' }
};
(async () => {
  for (const [code, data] of Object.entries(codes)) {
    await db.doc('access_codes/' + code).set(data);
    console.log('seeded', code);
  }
  process.exit(0);
})();
"
```

The old `NBD-ADMIN` and `NBD-JOE` codes are intentionally NOT seeded. Admin access must go through `setCustomUserClaims` above.

## 4. Deploy in this order

```bash
# 1. Rules first so the client can't exploit anything while functions roll out.
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase deploy --only storage

# 2. Functions (picks up the new secrets)
firebase deploy --only functions

# 3. Hosting (static site + new CSP headers)
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## 5. Delete the old stuff

- [ ] In Firebase Console → Functions, delete any lingering `seedDemoData` if the deploy missed it.
- [ ] In Cloudflare → Workers, delete the `nbd-ai-proxy` worker entirely (the repo stub returns 410 as a safety net).
- [ ] In Firebase Console → Authentication → Users, **delete the following service users** created by the old `validateAccessCode`: `demo@nobigdeal.pro`, `vip@nobigdeal.pro`, `admin@nobigdeal.pro`, `invite.2026@nobigdeal.pro`. They were created with a stable leaked password and anyone who has the hash can still sign in. Let them be recreated on demand by the new flow.
- [ ] Force-expire all existing Firebase sessions: `admin.auth().revokeRefreshTokens(uid)` for every existing user, or flip the project's password-reset requirement.

## 6. Turn on the Firebase Console switches

- [ ] **App Check** — Project Settings → App Check → register the web app with **reCAPTCHA Enterprise**. Enforce App Check on every Cloud Function. Enable debug token on localhost for dev.
- [ ] **Authentication → Settings → User actions → Email enumeration protection**: ON.
- [ ] **Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains**: remove any domains you don't control.
- [ ] **Firestore → Usage → Budgets**: set budget alert at $25/day.
- [ ] **Cloud Billing → Budgets**: add a $50/day project-wide budget alert (email + SMS to Joe).
- [ ] **Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials → Browser API key**: add HTTP referrer restriction to the three domains (see SECRET_ROTATION.md #8).

## 7. Twilio A2P 10DLC + geo-permissions

- [ ] Verify A2P 10DLC campaign is still active.
- [ ] Messaging Geo Permissions → allow **US & Canada only**. Deny everything else.

## 8. Smoke tests (on production, after deploy)

Run these as a freshly-registered free user, a paid user, and an admin:

- [ ] Free register → dashboard loads → `subscriptions/{uid}` is NOT writable from devtools.
- [ ] Free register → `setDoc(doc(db,'users',uid),{role:'admin'})` → PERMISSION_DENIED.
- [ ] Free register → `getDocs(collection(db,'access_codes'))` → PERMISSION_DENIED.
- [ ] `curl POST /seedDemoData` → 404.
- [ ] `curl POST /validateAccessCode '{"data":{"code":"NBD-ADMIN"}}'` → 403 (App Check missing) or `not-found`.
- [ ] `curl POST /incomingSMS` with an invalid signature → 403.
- [ ] `curl GET /imageProxy?path=anything` → 410 Gone (R-03 — function is retired; caller must use `POST /signImageUrl`).
- [ ] `curl POST /signImageUrl -d '{"path":"photos/<someone_else>/x.jpg"}'` with your ID token → 403.
- [ ] `curl GET https://nbd-ai-proxy.<acct>.workers.dev` → 410 (or 404 if you deleted the worker).
- [ ] Ask-Joe AI works for a paid user → `api_usage` doc appears → 30 calls in 1 min → 429.
- [ ] Stripe checkout works for a paid user → webhook creates `subscriptions/{uid}` → audit_log entry exists.
- [ ] Public estimate form submits → contact_leads doc is created → cannot be read by a free user.
- [ ] Admin vault loads only after setting custom claim.

## 9. 24-hour monitoring

- [ ] Watch Cloud Billing hourly for 24h.
- [ ] Watch Cloud Logging for the functions — filter by `severity=ERROR`.
- [ ] Watch Twilio spend dashboard for 24h.
- [ ] Watch Anthropic usage dashboard for 24h.
- [ ] If any spend spike > $25/hour, revoke keys again and investigate.

## 10. Phase-2 items (landed in the same branch)

- **innerHTML sweep** — every stored-XSS-reachable sink in `dashboard.html`, `customer.html`, `pro/vault.html`, and `docs/pro/js/crm.js` (notifications list = the incoming-SMS pivot) is now escaped via `window.nbdEsc`. Inline `onclick` handlers replaced with `addEventListener` so strict CSP can drop `'unsafe-inline'` in a future follow-up.
- **visualizer.html rebuild** — now calls a new `publicVisualizerAI` Cloud Function protected by App Check + per-IP rate limit (5/hour), model locked to Haiku, max_tokens 800, system prompt server-owned. Set `window.__NBD_RECAPTCHA_KEY__` in a script before the App Check bootstrap (or hard-code it in the `<head>`) to enable the endpoint. Until the key is set, the visualizer falls through to the canned fallback assessment.
- **sw.js** — now refuses to cache or serve auth-gated HTML (`/pro/dashboard.html`, `customer.html`, `vault.html`, `login.html`, `register.html`, `admin/**`, etc). A logged-out user can no longer see a stale cached dashboard. Cache versions bumped to `v5`.
- **Marketing site (`nobigdealwithjoedeal` project)** — a separate `marketing-site-firestore.rules` file has been added at the repo root. Deploy it against the marketing project with `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project nobigdealwithjoedeal`. This only allows `create` on `leads` with strict shape + size checks, and denies everything else.

### Phase-2 deploy steps

After completing sections 1–9 above, also do:

- [ ] `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project nobigdealwithjoedeal` from a directory pointing at `marketing-site-firestore.rules`.
- [ ] Register App Check with reCAPTCHA Enterprise for the `nobigdeal-pro` project and get the site key.
- [ ] Edit `docs/visualizer.html` and hard-code the reCAPTCHA site key in the `window.__NBD_RECAPTCHA_KEY__` script tag (or add it as a separate script before the module bootstrap), then redeploy hosting. Until this is done, the visualizer AI will silently fall back to the canned assessment.
- [ ] `firebase deploy --only functions:publicVisualizerAI` to ship the new public visualizer endpoint.
- [ ] Test the visualizer end-to-end: upload a photo, confirm the AI text comes back. Confirm 6th call from the same IP in an hour returns a 429.
- [ ] Test logging out of the dashboard, reloading `/pro/dashboard.html` with the tab offline → should get the offline page, NOT a stale cached dashboard.
- [ ] Re-run the XSS smoke tests on the dashboard and customer pages: create a lead with `firstName` = `"<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>"`, create a note with the same payload, add a contact_lead via the public form with `firstName` containing HTML → none should execute.

## 11. Phase-3 items (landed after phase-2)

- **SW kill-switch upgrade** — `docs/pro/sw.js` now actively deletes any auth-gated HTML cached in surviving cache versions on activate, claims all clients, and posts `SW_UPDATE_AVAILABLE` with the version. `docs/pro/js/offline-manager.js` catches the message and force-reloads any open tab sitting on an auth-gated path (once per activation, via a `sessionStorage` flag so you don't get a reload loop). On rollout, every existing tab will do one clean reload and pick up the new shell.

- **Admin-page innerHTML sweep** — `admin/analytics.html` and `admin/project-codex.html` now escape every rendered field. The search `highlight()` function in project-codex.html is the one I want you to look at — it escapes the raw text first, then re-inserts highlight spans via sentinel tokens. Can't be smuggled.

- **Offline page** — `docs/offline.html` rewritten to match the new SW behaviour (auth-gated HTML is never served from cache, auto-reload on reconnect).

- **Rate-limit tests** — `tests/rate-limit.test.js` runs against the emulator. Covers per-key / per-namespace isolation, window reset, burst enforcement, and deterministic hashing. Run with `cd tests && npm run test:ratelimit`.

- **Structured logging sweep** — `email-functions.js` / `sms-functions.js` / `verify-functions.js` no longer use `console.log`/`warn`/`error`; every event goes through `firebase-functions/v2` logger with a stable event name (`otp_sent`, `rate_limit_denied`, `claudeProxy error`, etc). Cloud Logging can now filter by `jsonPayload.message`.

- **Cloud Monitoring alert policies** — `monitoring/*.json` + `monitoring/README.md`. Four policies ready to import:
  1. `alert-validateAccessCode-bruteforce.json` — fires on `access_code_invalid` spikes
  2. `alert-functions-error-rate.json` — fires on Cloud Function ERROR log spikes
  3. `alert-claude-budget-exceeded.json` — fires when a user trips the daily token budget
  4. `alert-rate-limit-spike.json` — fires on `rate_limit_denied` spikes (the rate-limit helper now emits this event name)
  Replace `NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_ID` in each JSON with Joe's channel ID, then `gcloud alpha monitoring policies create --policy-from-file=monitoring/<file>.json`.

- **Stray empty file removed** — `functions/{const` deleted.

- **Report-only strict CSP** — added a `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header alongside the enforced CSP. The report-only version drops `'unsafe-inline'` from `script-src`, adds `script-src-attr 'none'`, and drops `'unsafe-inline'` from `style-src`. Browsers will log a console violation for every inline handler / inline script that still needs migration, **without blocking anything**. Use this to triage what's left before flipping it to the enforced CSP in a future follow-up.

### Phase-3 deploy steps

After completing sections 1–10:

- [ ] `cd tests && npm install && npm run test:ratelimit` — both rate-limit and rules tests should pass before deploy.
- [ ] `firebase deploy --only functions,hosting` to ship the sw.js upgrade + structured logs.
- [ ] For each Cloud Monitoring alert policy: list notification channels (`gcloud alpha monitoring channels list --project=nobigdeal-pro`), edit the JSON to replace `NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_ID`, then `gcloud alpha monitoring policies create --policy-from-file=monitoring/<file>.json`.
- [ ] Open the dashboard in a real browser with devtools open → watch for CSP-Report-Only violations. Each one is a remaining inline script/handler that needs to be migrated before flipping the enforced CSP to strict. Track them in a follow-up ticket.
- [ ] Smoke test the SW upgrade: on an already-signed-in browser, deploy, then reload. Should do one automatic reload and land on the new shell.

## 12. Strict CSP partial rollout (landed in commit ae35e46)

12 auth-gated pages were fully migrated to strict CSP (no `'unsafe-inline'`, no `script-src-attr`):
`/pro/login.html`, `/pro/register.html`, `/pro/stripe-success.html`, `/pro/analytics.html`,
`/pro/leaderboard.html`, `/pro/ask-joe.html`, `/pro/diagnostic.html`, `/pro/understand.html`,
`/pro/ai-tree.html`, `/admin/index.html`, `/admin/login.html`, `/admin/analytics.html`.

Each page has a per-path `Content-Security-Policy` header in `firebase.json` that drops
`'unsafe-inline'` from `script-src` and sets `script-src-attr 'none'`. The global CSP
(default `**/*.html`) still allows `'unsafe-inline'` so the non-migrated pages continue
to work; the per-path headers take precedence on the migrated ones.

**Stripe success flow change** — `/pro/stripe-success.html` was broken by the Phase-1
firestore.rules (the page tried to write `subscriptions/{uid}` + `users/{uid}.role`
directly). It was rewritten to poll the subscription doc via `onSnapshot` and wait for
the Stripe webhook to flip it active. Test the full checkout → webhook → success page
flow on staging before deploying.

## 13. Marketing site modular SDK migration (landed in this commit)

`docs/sites/**` previously used the Firebase compat SDK with `firebase.initializeApp(...)`
and `db.collection('leads').add(...)` inline. Every page has been migrated to:

  - A shared `/sites/js/marketing-firebase.js` module that initializes the modular
    SDK and attaches Firebase App Check (reCAPTCHA Enterprise, currently disabled
    until Joe sets the site key).
  - A glue `/sites/js/marketing-firebase-init.js` module that exposes
    `window._nbdSubmitLead(data)` so non-module host scripts (like
    `sites/oaks/shared.js`) can keep using a single global.
  - Every host page (`sites/index.html`, `sites/oaks.html`, `sites/template.html`,
    `sites/oaks/*.html`, `sites/oaks/services/*.html`) loads the modular init via
    `<script type="module" src="/sites/js/marketing-firebase-init.js">` instead of
    the old compat `<script>` pair + inline `firebase.initializeApp(...)`.
  - The `sites/template.html` lead submission no longer calls `notifyNewLead` from
    the client — that callable now requires App Check and an OTP-verified phone,
    both of which are out of scope for an unauthenticated marketing form.

### To enable App Check on the marketing site

- [ ] Register the marketing Firebase project (`nobigdealwithjoedeal`) in the
      Firebase Console → App Check → Web app.
- [ ] Create a reCAPTCHA Enterprise site key and copy it.
- [ ] Edit `docs/sites/js/marketing-firebase.js` and set
      `const MARKETING_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY = '...'`.
- [ ] `firebase deploy --only hosting` to push the updated marketing site.
- [ ] Turn on App Check enforcement on the marketing project in the console.

## 14. Firestore backup + restore runbook (Q2)

`functions/integrations/compliance.js::nightlyFirestoreBackup` runs
daily at 04:00 America/Chicago via Cloud Scheduler and exports the
entire Firestore database to `gs://nobigdeal-pro-backups/YYYY-MM-DD/`.
A missing day means restore capability is compromised until the next
successful run.

### 14.1 Verify backups are actually landing (weekly)

```
./scripts/verify-backup.sh
```

The script lists the last 7 calendar days of export folders in the
bucket, confirms each contains an `overall_export_metadata` file
(failed exports leave empty folders), and exits non-zero if fewer
than 2 days are present. Run from any machine with the `gcloud` CLI
authenticated to the `nobigdeal-pro` project.

Override the bucket via env: `BACKUP_BUCKET=... ./scripts/verify-backup.sh`.

### 14.2 Alerting

`monitoring/alert-backup-cron-stale.json` defines a Cloud Monitoring
alert that fires if the `nightlyFirestoreBackup` function has not
emitted its success log line in 26 hours. Wire it to your ops
notification channel:

```
gcloud alpha monitoring policies create \
  --policy-from-file=monitoring/alert-backup-cron-stale.json \
  --project=nobigdeal-pro
# then edit the policy in the console to attach the real
# notificationChannels id.
```

### 14.3 Restore procedure (practice this BEFORE you need it)

**Never restore straight into production.** Always stage into a
scratch project, diff the data, and then decide the scope.

1. Create (or reuse) a scratch Firebase project, e.g. `nbd-restore-drill`.
2. Grant the service account `roles/datastore.importExportAdmin` on
   both the source bucket and the destination project.
3. List available exports:
   ```
   gcloud storage ls gs://nobigdeal-pro-backups/
   ```
4. Import a specific day's export into the scratch project:
   ```
   gcloud firestore import gs://nobigdeal-pro-backups/2026-04-14/<export-name> \
     --project=nbd-restore-drill
   ```
   The import overwrites same-IDs; it does not delete docs that
   exist in the destination but not in the backup.
5. Verify the scratch data against the production delta. If you
   need to cherry-pick specific collections into prod:
   ```
   gcloud firestore import gs://nobigdeal-pro-backups/2026-04-14/<export-name> \
     --collection-ids='leads,estimates' \
     --project=nobigdeal-pro
   ```
6. Audit-log the operation manually:
   ```
   # from an admin context, write an audit_log entry describing
   # the scope of the restore, the operator, and the ticket ID.
   ```

### 14.4 Quarterly restore drill

Schedule a 1-hour quarterly calendar event. Follow 14.3 end-to-end
against the scratch project, confirm the most recent day restores
cleanly, and update the line below.

**Last successful drill:** _not yet performed — run one before
first real-customer revenue._

## 15. (Empty — reserved for next-wave work)

## 16. IAM grants required to re-enable the 8 IAM-blocked functions

The 2026-04-14 deploy sweep (branch
`claude/security-infrastructure-review-5GRpD`) surfaced two IAM
gaps on the GitHub Actions deploy SA that had crept in through
drift since the original project was set up:

  - `roles/cloudscheduler.admin` — needed to update Cloud Scheduler
    job bindings for scheduled functions.
  - `roles/identityplatform.admin` — needed to register / update
    blocking triggers (`beforeUserCreated`, `beforeUserSignedIn`).

Without these, the following 8 functions' DEPLOYS fail. Their
last-deployed Cloud Run revisions stay live and continue to run
their existing schedules / triggers — only the CODE UPDATE is
blocked. The CI workflow temporarily skips them on the main pass
and retries them with tolerance (producing a warning) in a second
pass (see `.github/workflows/firebase-deploy.yml` "Deploy Cloud
Functions").

Currently-blocked functions:
  - nightlyFirestoreBackup     (scheduled)
  - auditLogRetentionCron      (scheduled)
  - checkStormAlerts           (scheduled)
  - emailQueueWorker           (scheduled)
  - onFollowUpDue              (scheduled)
  - onAppointmentReminder      (scheduled)
  - hailMatchCron              (scheduled)
  - onRepSignup                (blocking trigger)

### 16.1 Grant the missing roles

Identify the deploy SA. If you still have the
`FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` JSON you pasted into GitHub Actions,
extract the `client_email`. Otherwise:

```
# Find the SA that ran the most recent deploy:
gcloud iam service-accounts list --project=nobigdeal-pro \
  --filter='displayName~"Firebase|deploy|github"'
```

Grant the two missing roles (replace `<DEPLOY_SA_EMAIL>`):

```
DEPLOY_SA=<DEPLOY_SA_EMAIL>
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding nobigdeal-pro \
  --member="serviceAccount:${DEPLOY_SA}" \
  --role="roles/cloudscheduler.admin"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding nobigdeal-pro \
  --member="serviceAccount:${DEPLOY_SA}" \
  --role="roles/identityplatform.admin"
```

### 16.2 Re-include the 8 functions in the main deploy

Edit `.github/workflows/firebase-deploy.yml`. Find both
`NBD_DEPLOY_SKIP_LIST` env var declarations (there are two — one
on each functions-deploy step) and change them to the empty string:

```
NBD_DEPLOY_SKIP_LIST: ""
```

Commit + push. The next deploy's main step will deploy everything
in one pass and the tolerant retry step will be a no-op.

### 16.3 Verification

After the next deploy:
  - `gcloud functions list --project=nobigdeal-pro --gen2 | grep -E '(nightlyFirestoreBackup|onRepSignup|hailMatchCron)'` — all 3 present with recent updateTime.
  - `gcloud scheduler jobs list --project=nobigdeal-pro --location=us-central1` — all 7 schedule jobs present.
  - `gcloud identity-platform config describe --project=nobigdeal-pro` — `blockingFunctions.triggers` includes `beforeCreate` (onRepSignup is mapped to beforeCreate).

## 17. Voice Intelligence — Pub/Sub + Eventarc bootstrap

The C1 Voice Intelligence pipeline uses a Gen-2 Storage trigger
(`onAudioUploaded` → `onObjectFinalized`). Gen-2 Storage triggers
fire through Eventarc, which in turn uses Pub/Sub. First-time
deploys on a project that never used a Gen-2 Storage trigger fail
with:

```
Error: Error generating the service identity for pubsub.googleapis.com.
```

The deploy workflow now auto-enables the APIs + generates the
service identities. If it can't (SA lacks `serviceusage.services.enable`),
run these once from a privileged identity (e.g., Joe's gcloud):

```
gcloud services enable \
  pubsub.googleapis.com eventarc.googleapis.com \
  run.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
  artifactregistry.googleapis.com \
  --project=nobigdeal-pro

gcloud beta services identity create \
  --service=pubsub.googleapis.com --project=nobigdeal-pro
gcloud beta services identity create \
  --service=eventarc.googleapis.com --project=nobigdeal-pro
```

After those succeed once, every subsequent deploy reuses the
existing service identities — this is a one-time bootstrap.

### 17.1 Runtime SA + Eventarc trigger role

The Eventarc trigger for `onAudioUploaded` needs the runtime SA
(default: `PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`)
to have `roles/eventarc.eventReceiver`. Firebase CLI grants this
on first successful deploy; if the SA was rotated, re-grant:

```
PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe nobigdeal-pro --format='value(projectNumber)')
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding nobigdeal-pro \
  --member="serviceAccount:${PROJECT_NUMBER}-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/eventarc.eventReceiver"
```

### 17.2 Pub/Sub signing SA for Cloud Storage events

Cloud Storage notifications are published to a Pub/Sub topic owned
by Firebase. The Cloud Storage service agent needs
`roles/pubsub.publisher`:

```
STORAGE_SA=$(gcloud storage service-agent --project=nobigdeal-pro)
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding nobigdeal-pro \
  --member="serviceAccount:${STORAGE_SA}" \
  --role="roles/pubsub.publisher"
```

Firebase CLI tries to do this automatically but the deploy SA may
lack the IAM admin role. Run once from Joe's identity.

### 17.3 Voice Intelligence secrets

- `GROQ_API_KEY` — required for Phase 1 transcription. Without it,
  every upload lands with `status: 'failed'` and
  `statusError: '[groq-not-configured] ...'`. Provision:
  ```
  firebase functions:secrets:set GROQ_API_KEY --project=nobigdeal-pro
  ```
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — already set for claudeProxy; the voice
  pipeline reuses it for analysis + consent checks.

## 18. Rate-limit provider (R-01) — flip to Upstash before launch

**Who:** ops (Joe). **When:** before 10k-user launch. **Why:**
Firestore documents have a ~1 write/sec/doc ceiling. `_rate_limits_ip/*`
is one doc per (namespace, hashed-IP), so when a mobile carrier NATs
thousands of users onto one egress IP every hit from that carrier
rewrites the same doc. Under load legitimate users get 429'd. Upstash
Redis has no such ceiling and adds ~15ms latency from us-central1.

The adapter is already in place (`functions/integrations/
upstash-ratelimit.js`). It's a drop-in replacement that keeps the
Firestore limiter wired as a failover path for transient Upstash
errors. All you need to do is provision + flip.

### 18.1 Create the Redis instance

1. <https://console.upstash.com> → **Create Database**.
2. **Name**: `nbd-pro-ratelimit`. **Region**: choose the `us-central1`-
   closest regional (not global — lower latency, lower cost at this
   scale). **Eviction**: keep the default allkeys-lru.
3. Copy the **REST URL** and **REST Token** from the dashboard.

### 18.2 Provision the two secrets

```
firebase functions:secrets:set UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL --project=nobigdeal-pro
firebase functions:secrets:set UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN --project=nobigdeal-pro
```

Paste the matching values when prompted. These are NOT stubbed by
CI at deploy time — the stub uses the `__unset__` sentinel which
the adapter treats as "not configured" (see
`integrations/_shared.js:hasSecret`).

### 18.3 Flip the provider

`NBD_RATE_LIMIT_PROVIDER` is a plain env var (not a secret). Set it
on every function that reads rate limits. With the current codebase
that's effectively every HTTP / callable function in
`functions/index.js` + `sms-functions.js` + `compliance.js`.

The simplest path is the functions runtime env:

```
firebase functions:config:set nbd.rate_limit_provider=upstash --project=nobigdeal-pro
```

…or set it directly in `functions/package.json` `functions.env` if
you prefer an in-repo declaration. Redeploy functions afterwards.

### 18.4 Verify the flip landed

Two signals:

1. **Cold-start log**: search Cloud Logging for
   `jsonPayload.message="rate_limit_provider_info"`. Each fresh
   container logs:
   ```
   rate_limit_provider_info  envPref=upstash upstashConfigured=true active=upstash
   ```
   If any instance logs `rate_limit_provider_drift` instead,
   provisioning didn't complete — fix 18.2 and redeploy.

2. **integrationStatus callable**: sign in as a platform admin and
   invoke `integrationStatus`. The response now includes
   `rateLimitProvider: "upstash"` (was `"firestore"` pre-flip). This
   is the post-deploy smoke-check Joe / ops can run from devtools
   in one line:
   ```js
   firebase.functions().httpsCallable('integrationStatus')().then(r => console.log(r.data.rateLimitProvider));
   ```
   Expected: `"upstash"`. Anything else blocks launch.

### 18.5 Rollback

If Upstash misbehaves post-launch, unset the env var and redeploy —
the adapter immediately reverts to the Firestore limiter with no
code change needed. The Firestore limiter is slower under load but
correct.


- **Full inline-script removal on the big pages** — `dashboard.html` (~435 onclick handlers), `customer.html` (~114), `ai-tool-finder.html` (~61), `landing.html` (~15), `admin/vault.html` (~32) still use inline scripts + handlers. The Phase-3 Report-Only CSP header shows every violation in the devtools console so you can triage them. Plan a focused sprint to extract these to external files.
- **Populate `functions/data/zip-to-county.json`** with the full zip→county map for every service area before re-enabling storm alerts.
- **`docs/pro/js/_archive/` directory** — 33 legacy JS files, ~1.1 MB, not loaded by any current HTML. Can be deleted once you're confident nothing references them.
- **Inline `<style>` tags on migrated pages** — the strict CSP on migrated pages still keeps `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` because every page has inline `<style>` blocks. Removing this requires per-page stylesheet extraction. Low priority; `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` is not an XSS vector on its own.
