/**
 * functions/lead-bridge.js — public lead → CRM pipeline bridge (Phase C, H-1).
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Fixes the live-QA H-1 finding: public-form submissions land in the
 * per-kind public collections (contact_leads / estimate_leads /
 * inspect_leads / free_roof_entries) but never reached the CRM `leads`
 * pipeline, so the owner had to re-enter them by hand from the alert email.
 *
 * These onCreate triggers mirror each high-intent public lead into the
 * tenant's `leads` collection so it shows up in the pipeline (stage "New",
 * source "Website — …"). Purely ADDITIVE — runs alongside lead-alert.js
 * (which still emails/texts) and does NOT touch submitPublicLead or the
 * public collections. A bridge failure never blocks intake or the alert.
 *
 * Routing is tenant-aware: the lead's validated companyId resolves to that
 * tenant's owner (companies/{companyId}.ownerId). NBD's main forms pass no
 * companyId → the lead is mirrored to the tenant-zero owner (Joe), so NBD
 * is byte-identical. Writes go through the admin SDK (bypasses rules) since
 * a public submit has no authenticated user.
 *
 * Idempotent: the mirrored doc uses a deterministic id derived from the
 * source (collection + source doc id), so a re-delivered trigger create()s
 * a no-op instead of a duplicate lead.

// match, so a wrapper-exported trigger is silently dropped from the deploy
// (the same latent gap that quietly keeps lead-alert.js's makeTrigger exports
// off the CI auto-deploy — they only ship via a manual full `firebase deploy`).
// Keep the RHS a literal factory call so a push to main actually deploys these.
