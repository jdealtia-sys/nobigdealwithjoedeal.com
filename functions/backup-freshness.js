/**
 * functions/backup-freshness.js — the alarm that would have caught it.
 *
 * WHAT HAPPENED (2026-09-03)
 * ──────────────────────────
 * Three Firestore backup functions — dailyFirestoreBackup (03:15),
 * nightlyFirestoreBackup (04:00) and firestoreBackupRetention (03:45) — were
 * deployed, ACTIVE and scheduled, and had failed EVERY NIGHT since the day
 * they shipped. Two independent causes: the destination bucket had never been
 * created (firestore-backup.js's own docstring says the operator must, and
 * nobody did), and the runtime service account holds roles/editor, which
 * deliberately excludes datastore.databases.export. Both are fixed.
 *
 * The database had never once been backed up, and nothing said so. Adding a
 * backup was not the fix — the backups already existed. The missing piece was
 * anything at all checking the OUTCOME.
 *
 * firestore-backup.js already named the artifact to check:
 *   "Success/failure of the export itself lands in the GCS bucket as
 *    `*.overall_export_metadata` files; operator checks there."
 * No operator ever did. This function is that operator.
 *
 * DESIGN NOTES, each one load-bearing
 * ───────────────────────────────────
 * 1. IT IS A SEPARATE FUNCTION, not a section of healthDigestCron. The digest
 *    is informational and, more importantly, is gated on
 *    HEALTH_DIGEST_ENABLED — an alarm that a config flag can silently switch
 *    off is the bug, not the fix.
 * 2. IT HAS NO ENABLE GATE, deliberately, unlike most crons here. There is no
 *    legitimate reason to run this system with its backup alarm turned off,
 *    and every *_ENABLED flag is one more way for this to go quiet again.
 * 3. IT CHECKS THE MARKER, NOT THE FUNCTION LOGS. A failing export writes
 *    nothing; a partial one leaves output-* files with no marker. Only
 *    `overall_export_metadata` means "an export finished". Checking the
 *    artifact rather than the process is what makes this independent of
 *    whatever broke.
 * 4. IT FAILS LOUD. No marker, an unreadable timestamp, or a future-dated one
 *    all raise the alarm. "Cannot tell" must never render as "fine" — see
 *    backup-freshness-logic.js.
 * 5. IT EMAILS. The old failures were visible in Cloud Logging the whole time
 *    and nobody was reading Cloud Logging. It queues to email_queue/, the same
 *    path healthDigestCron uses and emailQueueWorker drains — including
 *    status:'pending', without which the worker never claims the row (a
 *    silent-drop that health-digest.js documents in its own comment).
