/**
 * NBD — TCPA consent, as a stored fact rather than an inference
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Background (2026-09-04). The /estimate funnel hard-disables its submit
 * button until the homeowner ticks the express-written-consent box, and it
 * posts `tcpaConsent: true` with the lead. The funnel's own comment says the
 * value is "stored explicitly so the record is audit-ready and the SMS-ack
 * trigger can rely on it".
 *
 * Neither half was true in production:
 *
 *   1. submitPublicLead's M-04 optional-field allowlist only ever accepted
 *      STRINGS (`typeof v !== 'string'` → continue), and `tcpaConsent` was not
 *      on the estimate kind's list at all. The boolean was dropped on every
 *      submission, so NO lead has ever carried a consent record.
 *   2. lead-alert's `ackHomeownerSms` never read the field. It inferred
 *      consent from `collection === 'estimate_leads'` — i.e. from the funnel's
 *      UI construction — so any document landing in that collection by any
 *      other route (an import, a migration, a backfill, a seed, a future
 *      second form) would be texted with nothing to show for it.
 *
 * That is the difference between BELIEVING you have consent and being able to
 * SHOW it. This module is the second half: one place that answers "may we text
 * this person, and if not, why not" from the stored record only.
 *
 * Fail-closed by construction: a missing field is not consent, a string
 * "true" written by some future caller is not consent, and only an explicit
 * boolean `true` opens the gate. Legacy leads created before the persistence
 * fix therefore never receive the ack — correctly, because no consent record
 * exists for them and one cannot be invented after the fact.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free so it is unit-testable without emulators
 * (tests/tcpa-consent.test.js), following the *-logic.js convention.

 * said nothing must never have `false` written for them: an absent field and a
 * declined checkbox are different facts, and only one of them is evidence.
 *
 * Accepts the exact string forms too, because the gateway takes JSON today but
