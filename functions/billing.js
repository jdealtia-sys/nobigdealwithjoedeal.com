/**
 * billing.js — server-side usage tracking for plan limits.
 *
 * Closes the Audit A KNOWN GAP: firestore.rules locks
 * subscriptions/{uid} writes (`allow write: if false`) so the
 * client-side billing-gate.js used to silently 403 on every
 * trackUsage call. Local-session counters worked, but cross-
 * session / cross-device usage was lost. Reps could refresh and
 * "get" their lead allowance back.
 *
 * Now: trackUsage is a callable that atomically increments
 * subscriptions/{uid}.usage[feature] via the admin SDK and
 * returns the post-increment state plus the plan limit, so the
 * client can render an accurate "X of Y leads this month" gauge.
 *
 * Rate limit: 200/min/uid — generous enough that a rep logging
 * a busy day's leads never hits it, tight enough to block a
 * pathological loop.
