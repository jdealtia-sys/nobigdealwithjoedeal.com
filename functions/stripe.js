/**
 * functions/stripe.js — Stripe Cloud Functions.
 *
 * L-03 continuation. Six handlers extracted verbatim from
 * functions/index.js: createCheckoutSession, stripeWebhook,
 * createCustomerPortalSession, getSubscriptionStatus,
 * createStripePaymentLink, invoiceWebhook.
 *
 * index.js loads this via `Object.assign(exports, require('./stripe'))`
 * — same pattern used for functions/portal.js (L-03).
 *
 * No behaviour change. Every handler keeps its exact config
 * (maxInstances, concurrency, timeoutSeconds, minInstances, memory,
 * secrets, cors) and body. NOTE: the onRequest handlers here previously
 * also carried `enforceAppCheck: true`, which firebase-functions honours on
 * onCall ONLY. It was removed 2026-08-02 as dead config — these endpoints
 * are gated by Stripe webhook signature verification and per-IP limits, not
 * by App Check. See handlers/ai.js for the full write-up.

// WHERE THE MONEY GOES — read this before touching the gate.
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// Stripe here serves TWO different money flows through ONE client on the
// PLATFORM's secret key:
//
//   1. Subscription billing — a contractor paying us for NBD Pro. The money is
//      ours. Correct on the platform key. Untouched by this gate.
//   2. Invoice payment links — a contractor's HOMEOWNER paying the CONTRACTOR
//      for a roof. That money is the contractor's. It is NOT ours to collect.
//
// REWRITTEN 2026-07-3x (Connect phase 3). The premise this block used to carry
// — "there is no Stripe Connect in this codebase, grep and see" — is now FALSE,
// deliberately. Flow 2 used to settle every tenant's customer payments into the
// PLATFORM balance, correct while we were the only tenant but not one minute
// after anyone else could sign up. The reasons were never cosmetic:
//   - chargebacks hit our account and our dispute rate, for work we did not do
//   - the 1099-K reports their revenue as ours
//   - collecting funds on behalf of other businesses is regulated activity;
//     Connect exists precisely so a platform doesn't have to be licensed for it
//   - we would owe every contractor a manual payout, forever
//
// So createStripePaymentLink now mints a DESTINATION charge for a tenant whose
// connectAccounts/{companyId} mirror satisfies mayCollectOnline() AND who holds
// a live subscription — that money settles into THEIR account, net of the
// platform fee. The platform tenant keeps minting on the platform account,
// fee-free. Everyone else is still refused (403) and collects via markPaid.
//
// DO NOT relax the refusal to "warn and continue". Minting the link is the act
// that takes the money; a warning the rep clicks past does not change where it goes.

//      kills it. (Supersedes the per-site trim in draft PR #711.)
//   2. maxNetworkRetries + a bounded timeout so a transient network blip
//      self-heals instead of bubbling up as a 500.

        //                                      if funds are already withdrawn
        //   - charge.dispute.funds_withdrawn — the escalation/withdrawal
        //                                      event; recovers when the debit
        //                                      actually lands

        // created WITHOUT funds_withdrawn is the dangerous half-state: an
        // inquiry that escalates into a real chargeback would then never be
        // recovered and the platform eats the full charge.
        // Deliberately NOT handled: charge.dispute.updated. It carries no
        // money truth (a status flip alone does not move funds) and would
        // only duplicate alerts; funds_withdrawn is the debit itself.
        //
        // REWRITTEN 2026-07-30 (close-out audit of #1145). This comment used
        // to read "Reversal FIRST and its errors PROPAGATE (marker-delete →
        // Stripe retry re-runs it; the dispute-keyed idempotencyKey makes the
        // re-run a no-op). Alerts after, best-effort." — i.e. a propagating
        // reversal was DELIBERATE. That premise was wrong twice over:
        //   1. the alert sat AFTER the reversal, so a reversal failure told
        //      the owner NOTHING — the chargeback itself landed in silence,
        //      which is the one thing this branch exists to prevent;
        //   2. the failure this call actually hits is `balance_insufficient`
        //      on a daily-payout Express account — the NORMAL state, and
        //      PERMANENT: no amount of retrying makes a spent balance
        //      reversible. Stripe would retry the delivery for ~3 days and
        //      auto-disable an endpoint that keeps 500ing, which would stop
        //      payment_intent.succeeded from crediting invoices for EVERY
        //      tenant, platform included. A recovery we cannot make today is
        //      never worth the credit path.
        // So the reversal is now NON-FATAL in its own try/catch: the owner is
        // ALWAYS alerted that a chargeback opened, and the alert distinguishes
        // "recovered from the contractor" from "RECOVERY FAILED, the platform
        // is out this money". Marker discipline is UNCHANGED for genuine
        // infrastructure errors elsewhere in the branch (the charge/PI reads,
        // Firestore) — only this one money call is swallowed. The
