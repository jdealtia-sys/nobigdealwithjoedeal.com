/**
 * functions/handlers/ai-persona.js — T-4: persona prompt builder (PURE)
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Dependency-free so it unit-tests in plain node (no firebase imports)
 * and so the same prompt assembly runs in BOTH the live draft path
 * (handlers/ai-texting.js) and the Settings live-preview callable
 * (handlers/ai-texting-preview.js) — one source of truth for the prompt.
 *
 * The persona splits into three layers; reps may edit the first two,
 * NEVER the third:
 *   1. IDENTITY  — who the assistant is (rep + company), templated.
 *   2. STYLE     — tone, built from trait sliders (0–100 → wording).
 *   3. HARD RULES (guardrails) — LOCKED. Always appended last and
 *      declared to override everything above, so no preset, slider, or
 *      free-text note can weaken "never quote a price", "escalate angry
 *      customers", the TCPA identity disclosure, etc.
 *
 * We persist only the structured config (slider values, identity, notes)
 * and rebuild the prompt here at draft time — never a stored prompt
 * string — so the guardrails are always current and a rep can never save
 * a guardrail-free prompt.
