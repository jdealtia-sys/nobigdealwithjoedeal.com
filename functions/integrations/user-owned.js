/**
 * integrations/user-owned.js — canonical registry of every Firestore
 * collection, collectionGroup, Storage prefix, and owner-keyed doc
 * path that is tied to a single end-user uid.
 *
 * Single source of truth for:
 *   - `confirmAccountErasure` (M-01): GDPR Article 17 cascade. A user
 *     who requests right-to-be-forgotten expects every trace of their
 *     data removed. Before this registry, the cascade named 7 flat
 *     collections and 1 collection-group; the full list below is 21
 *     flat collections, 2 groups, 8 Storage prefixes, 5 owner-keyed
 *     uid-path docs, and the vestigial nested-leads subtree.
 *
 *   - `exportMyData` (M-02): GDPR Article 20 data export. Same shape,
 *     read side. A dump that omits 2/3 of the user's data is not a
 *     portable export.
 *
 * Rule for additions: if a new collection, subcollection, or Storage
 * prefix stores user data keyed by uid (via a field or a path
 * segment), it goes in THIS file before it lands in a rule file. The
 * registry is the blast-radius map. If it's not here, erasure and
 * export both silently miss it.
 *
 * Rule for exclusions: append-only audit trails (audit_log,
 * account_erasures) are intentionally excluded — the whole point of
 * those is to survive account deletion.

// NOT listed: `leads/{leadId}/tasks|notes` — those use the PARENT

];

// ─── STORAGE PREFIXES ───────────────────────────────────────
// Every Storage bucket path of the shape `<prefix>/{uid}/...`.
// Right-to-be-forgotten means deleting the binary payloads too, not
// just the Firestore row.
//
// This list used to say "per storage.rules", and that framing is what
// let it drift: storage.rules is not a registry of what exists, only of
// what has a rule. Four prefixes were missing on 2026-09-08 — `documents`
// and `esign` had rules blocks nobody had mirrored here, while
// `pdf-renders` and `homeowner-uploads` are written by the ADMIN SDK
// (which bypasses rules entirely) and had no block at all, so no amount
// of reading storage.rules would ever have found them.
//
// scripts/check-storage-prefix-registry.js now derives the true set from
// BOTH sources — `match /<prefix>/{uid}/` blocks in storage.rules AND
// `<prefix>/${uid}/` write sites in functions/ + docs/**/js/ — and fails
// if either names a prefix this list omits. Add the prefix here when you
// add the write site; the gate will tell you if you forget.
//
// SCOPE: this list is the EXPORT scope (GDPR Art. 15) — everything the
// user can obtain. Erasure (Art. 17) uses ERASURE_STORAGE_PREFIXES below,
// which is this list minus a documented retention hold.
const STORAGE_PREFIXES = [
  'audio',
  'photos',
  'docs',
  // `portals/{uid}/...` covers the legacy baked-HTML customer portals
  // (portals/{uid}/{leadId}/v-<ts>.html + portals/{uid}/{leadId}-photos.html).
  // Those static files carry permanent, never-expiring Storage download-token
  // URLs that bypass Security Rules, so erasure MUST delete them — the
  // Firestore lead row alone isn't enough. The prefix sweep below
  // (deleteFiles `portals/{uid}/`) removes every version + the photo gallery
  // in one call. (The live portal is token-based and stores no Storage blob.)
  'portals',
  'galleries',
  'reports',
  'shared_docs',
  'deal_rooms',
  // receipts/{uid}/... — original receipt images/PDFs backing expense docs
  // (Phase 1 expense subsystem). Owner-keyed like docs/; erase with the account.
  'receipts',
  // documents/{uid}/{leadId}/{docId}.html — generated + signed customer
  // documents (document-generator.js onPersistFinalized, storage.rules:96).
  // Added 2026-09-08. onLeadDeleted already reaps this prefix per-lead
  // (lead-artifact-cleanup.js LEAD_KEYED_PREFIXES), so erasure was clearing
  // MOST of it as a side effect of deleting the lead rows — best-effort,
  // via a trigger with `retry: false`, and blind to any object whose lead
  // row was already gone. Listing it here makes the sweep deterministic and
  // catches those orphans. They historically carried permanent download
  // tokens (documentation/audit/ORPHANED-STORAGE-ARTIFACTS-2026-08-18.md),
  // where deletion is the only revocation there is.
  'documents',
  // esign/{uid}/{leadId}/{envelopeId}/{source,signed}.pdf — e-sign envelopes

  'esign',
  // homeowner-uploads/{ownerUid}/{leadId}/{ts}.{ext} — photos the HOMEOWNER
  // submits through the portal (portal.js uploadHomeownerPhoto). Admin-SDK
  // write, no storage.rules block, and not a `photos/` object, so neither the
  // rules file nor the lead reaper ever named it. The upload files its
  // Firestore row into `photos` (which IS erased) while the bytes landed
  // here, so erasure deleted the pointer and left the image. Same content
  // class as photos/ — a customer's property — so it erases with it.
  'homeowner-uploads',
  // pdf-renders/{uid}/{ts}-{slug}.pdf — server-rendered invoices, contracts,
  // warranties and reports (render-pdf.js). In neither the export nor the
  // erasure sweep since the renderer shipped. Objects written before
  // 2026-09-08 carry permanent download tokens, which makes deleting them
  // the only revocation available.

// ─── ERASURE RETENTION HOLDS ────────────────────────────────
// Prefixes that are EXPORTED but deliberately NOT erased.
//
// GDPR Art. 17(3) carves out erasure where processing is necessary for
// the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. An executed,
// counter-signed contract is the paradigm case: it is the record of an
// agreement between two parties, and the other party's interest in it
// does not end because one party asks to be forgotten.
//
// Decided by Jo on 2026-09-08, deliberately and not as a code cleanup:
// esign/ holds source.pdf + signed.pdf for every envelope. Nothing has
// ever deleted one — it is absent from LEAD_KEYED_PREFIXES too — so this
// is not a new hold, it is the existing behaviour finally written down
// and made honest to the data subject (confirmAccountErasure reports
// what it retained; see compliance.js).
//
// Anything listed here MUST also be in STORAGE_PREFIXES, so that what is
// retained is at least obtainable by the person asking. The registry gate
// enforces that.
const ERASURE_RETAINED_PREFIXES = [
  'esign',

// puts it on the retention list above.

// ─── OWNER-KEYED UID-PATH DOCS ───────────────────────────────

// Vestigial `leads/{uid}/leads/{leadId}` path from an old schema
// (firestore.rules:140-145). No current writer, but the rule still
// permits the owner to write here, and previous GDPR sweeps missed
// the subtree. Erasure uses `db.recursiveDelete(NESTED_LEADS_PATH(uid))`
