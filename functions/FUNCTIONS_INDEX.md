# NBD Pro — Cloud Functions Taxonomy

Single canonical index of every export from `functions/`. Refreshed 2026-08-11 by re-enumerating `require('./index.js')` (184 exported keys = **165 deployed Cloud Functions + 19 helper/test-only exports** [re-enumerated 2026-08-26: **189 keys = 170 deployed + 19 helper**; re-enumerated 2026-09-14: **208 keys = 184 deployed + 24 helper**, cross-checked against `scripts/check-function-orphans.js`'s own live count (184 export(s) with `__endpoint` · 184 deployed, zero orphans)]; 7 dead exports retired 2026-08-11 — sendEstimateEmail, sendDripEmail, triggerProcessRecording, reprocessRecording, auditCustomerDataIntegrity, backfillCustomerData, migratePinsToKnocks (dead-surface lane, Jo-approved; **corrected 2026-09-14: console deletion is DONE, not queued** — all eight (this seven plus the earlier `sendTeamInviteEmail`) were confirmed deleted from `gcloud functions list` on 2026-09-04, see `documentation/audit/STABILITY-AUDIT-2026-09-04.md` — the "queued in WEEKLY_CADENCE" line above was itself the stale, no-longer-true retirement-note comment that audit found and fixed); the 2026-08-05 count of 189 predated Swath's +3 (#1193) and CL8's −1 `sendTeamInviteEmail` retirement (#1190)). A CI tripwire (tests/smoke/dashboard.test.js "every index.js export appears in FUNCTIONS_INDEX") now fails when an export is added without a row here — the 2026-07-04→08-05 gap was 21 undocumented exports, including the whole Stripe Connect + seat-billing money path.

Classification matters because:
- **Admin** functions must enforce `request.auth.token.role === 'admin'` (or `requireAuth({ adminOnly: true })` for `onRequest`). If one silently loses that gate, the smoke test below catches it.
- **Public** functions intentionally accept unauthenticated traffic (Stripe webhook, portal token POST, public lead form). They must compensate with signature verification, rate limiting, or token-bound access.
- **Rep** functions are the normal client surface — App Check + auth required, owner-scoped reads/writes.
- **Background/trigger** functions don't take client traffic; they fire on Firestore writes, Storage uploads, or scheduled cron.

Blanket posture note (re-verified 2026-08-05): **every `onCall` export sets `enforceAppCheck: true`** — no exceptions. `onRequest` endpoints do NOT carry the option any more: `enforceAppCheck` is silently ignored on `onRequest` (honoured only inside `onCall` — vendored SDK `lib/v2/providers/https.js`), so the dead config was removed 2026-08-02 (#1170). Authed `onRequest` endpoints gate on ID-token verification + rate limits in the handler body; public ones on signatures/tokens/rate limits per the PUBLIC table.

**2026-08-18, landed 2026-08-26 (+2 → 189 keys = 170 deployed + 19 helper, re-enumerated at merge; the base had drifted +3 past the 08-11 refresh while this PR sat open — calcomWebhook among them):** `getDocumentHtml` (REP) and `onLeadDeleted` (TRIGGERS) landed with the orphaned-Storage-artifact fix. Deleting a lead removed the Firestore doc and nothing else, leaving generated customer HTML live in Storage under a permanent, unrevocable download token — 10 such orphans found in prod across `portals/`, `documents/` and `galleries/`. See `documentation/audit/ORPHANED-STORAGE-ARTIFACTS-2026-08-18.md`.

If you add a new export, list it here so the next audit doesn't have to re-derive the picture.

## REP (normal client surface — App Check + Firebase auth, owner-scoped)

| Export | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `claudeProxy` | onRequest | Server-side Anthropic relay with daily budget reservation (Bearer ID token); rate-limited per-uid + per-IP via `guardHttp` (rate-limit-policy.js pilot, 2026-08-10) |
| `signImageUrl` | onRequest | Signed Storage URL for owner/manager-scoped photo reads |
| `getThursdayRecording` | onCall | Streams a Thursday call recording (Storage `calls/{uid}/`) as base64 — owner, platform admin, or same-company reader (company_admin/manager/viewer, mirroring the `thursday_calls` read rule); no download token is minted |
| `thursdayCallAction` | onCall | Thursday inbox actions (mark reviewed, confirm possible match, create lead, attach to lead, reprocess) — refuses viewers; owner / platform admin / company_admin / manager of the call's company; re-verifies the target lead's companyId before any write |
| `callCenterAction` | onCall | Call Center screen writes on `phone_calls` (server-written only): `handled` / `unhandled`, `taskDone` / `taskUndone`, `snooze` / `unsnooze` (the Said-you'd-do deck), `attach {leadId}` (same-tenant lead; caller's number onto the lead, blanks only; timeline + create-only follow-up task for a noted call; then every other unfiled call, day of texts and text from the same number in the same tenant is filed on that lead too), `move {leadId}` (customer page "Wrong customer": call + its timeline entry + its task move to another lead; both leads must be in the call's company) — refuses viewers and sales reps; owner / platform admin / company_admin / manager of the call's company; App Check enforced (call-center.js) |
| `callPromisesList` | onCall | The Call Center "Said you'd do" deck: every open item from the twice-daily sweep (same `gatherSweep` as the email), uncapped. Owner or platform admin only. |
| `callTaggedMatch` | onCall | "Match my tagged contacts" (Call Center): `{}` previews calls to phone contacts tagged "NBD Customer" that sit on no lead — each number paired with the one lead it matches, or listed as not in the CRM yet; writes nothing. `{confirm:[{key,leadId}]}` files only the confirmed rows, re-planned server-side (a row whose match changed is skipped). Owner or platform admin only; App Check enforced (call-center.js) |
| `getGameCard` | onCall | The optional game card (Settings › Appearance): level, XP and this week vs last week, derived on request from the caller's own tasks, calls, leads and collected invoices (game-logic.js). Read-only; nothing stored. |
| `imageProxy` | onRequest | **Deprecated 410 stub** (H-01 stored-XSS fix) — fails loudly for stale clients; "safe to delete outright after 7+ days of zero calls in Cloud Logs" |
| `analyzeRoofPhoto` | onRequest | Vision over a single photo (rep view) |
| `analyzePhotoVision` | onCall | Per-photo Claude Vision classifier ($10/lead + $50/uid-month caps, sha256 cache) |
| `extractReceiptData` | onCall | Receipt OCR — Claude-vision extraction into structured expense-form fields |
| `validateAccessCode` | onCall | Login flow — exchanges access code for trial access; rate-limited per-IP + per-uid via `guardCallable` (rate-limit-policy.js pilot, 2026-08-10) |
| `activateInvitedRep` | onCall | Team-invite acceptance (legacy access-code path) |
| `claimInvite` | onCall | Pillar 1 phase 3 — claim a team invite on first dashboard load (replaces the never-deployable onRepSignup blocking trigger) |
| `mintOwnerClaims` | onCall | Stamps `{ owner: true, role: 'admin' }` on the founder accounts in `handlers/_shared.js` `OWNER_EMAILS` (the single server-side owner list); called by nbd-auth.js at login when the owner claim is missing |
| `revokeMySessions` | onCall | Self-service "Sign Out Everywhere" (2026-09-08) — revokes the CALLER's own refresh tokens. Self-scoped by construction: uid comes from the verified token, no target parameter, so it cannot become an admin path. The only caller-scoped revoke in the tree; the five `revokeRefreshTokens` calls in `handlers/admin.js` / `invites.js` / `compliance.js` / `lapse-enforcement.js` are all admins acting on someone else. Rate-limited per-uid + per-IP via `guardCallable` (5/hr, 20/hr). Kills refresh tokens only — an ID token already issued survives up to ~1h, which is why the UI promises "within an hour at most" |
| `createCompany` | onCall | Pillar 1 phase 2 — self-serve tenant provisioning (companies/{uid} + companyProfile seed + owner claims) |
| `setSiteSlug` | onCall | Pillar 5 — tenant sets a human slug for their public microsite (validated + reserved-word list) |
| `createPortalToken` | onCall | Mints a portal-share token for a lead |
| `revokePortalToken` | onCall | Revokes outstanding portal tokens |
| `replyToPortalMessage` | onCall | Rep reply to a homeowner message |
| `createSignRequest` | onCall | Remote signing — rep mints a doc_sign_token + emails the homeowner the sign link |
| `createEsignEnvelope` | onCall | Envelope signing — registers a rep-uploaded PDF; reads page geometry and the source SHA-256 SERVER-side so neither is client-asserted |
| `saveEsignFields` | onCall | Envelope signing — persists the field layout (PDF user-space points). Refused once the envelope is sent: the layout is part of what the signer was shown |
| `getEsignEnvelopeForOwner` | onCall | Envelope signing — rep re-opens a draft. A callable, NOT a Storage read: getDownloadURL would mint a permanent token that bypasses storage.rules |
| `sendEsignEnvelope` | onCall | Envelope signing — mints the single-use link and emails it. Called again it ROTATES, revoking the old link. Refuses an envelope with zero fields |
| `voidEsignEnvelope` | onCall | Envelope signing — revokes every live token for an envelope. Refused once signed |
| `createDealAcceptToken` | onCall | Close Board — rep mints a deal_accept_token for a deal room they own |
| `createReportShareToken` | onCall | Rep mints a no-login view link for a saved inspection report |
| `createCalendarFeedToken` | onCall | Rep mints (or rotates) the secret `/calendar/<token>.ics` URL for their own schedule. One active token per rep; minting revokes the previous one, which is this feature's only revocation path |
| `getDocumentPdfUrl` | onCall | A 10-minute signed link to a FILED PDF on the Documents tab (NBD-500 invoice / NBD-510 receipt from `moneyPaperOnInvoice`), after the same lead check as `getDocumentHtml`. `pdfPath` is confined to `documents/<owner>/<thisLeadId>/*.pdf`. A signed URL is fine for a PDF (it does not execute as a page, unlike HTML) (2026-09-30) |
| `getDocumentHtml` | onCall | Reads a generated document's HTML back for the Documents tab (owner/manager/admin, admin-SDK read of `htmlPath`). Replaces the permanent `getDownloadURL` that docgen used to persist as `documents/{id}.htmlUrl` — an unrevocable no-auth URL for a signed contract. A signed URL is NOT the alternative: HTML fetched from `storage.googleapis.com` executes in that origin, which is why `signImageUrl` excludes every HTML prefix (its H-01 note) |
| `trackUsage` | onCall | Plan-usage increment (atomic, server-side) |
| `integrationAvailability` | onCall | Non-admin-safe counterpart to the admin-gated `integrationStatus` below — any authenticated caller, no role check. Returns ONLY the booleans that gate `requestMeasurement` / `sendEstimateForSignature` / `lookupParcel` (hover, eagleview, nearmap, instantroofer, boldsign, regrid) plus the active provider per category; none of the H-06-restricted fields (Turnstile/Upstash/Sentry/Slack/webhook secrets/rotationRunbook). Added 2026-09-14: `integrations-client.js`'s `status()` used to short-circuit for non-admins into a permanently-empty `configured: {}` without ever calling the server, which made every ordinary rep's Auto-measure / e-sign / parcel-lookup buttons report "not set up" regardless of actual config |
| `lookupParcel` | onCall | Parcel lookup w/ 90-day cache — Regrid (default) or Swath per `NBD_PARCEL_PROVIDER`, other provider is the fallback |
| `requestMeasurement` | onCall | Roof measurement request — Instant Roofer (default: coordinates-in AI measure, synchronous; or `reportType:'human'` for the ~1 h certified report) / Hover / EagleView / Nearmap per `NBD_MEASUREMENT_PROVIDER` |
| `sendEstimateForSignature` | onCall | BoldSign embedded-signing flow (was listed here as `sendForSignature` — actual export name is `sendEstimateForSignature`) |
| `getHailHistory` | onCall | Storm history within radius — NOAA (default) / HailTrace / Swath per `NBD_HAIL_PROVIDER`, NOAA fallback (routes through shared `lookupHail`) |
| `getSwathReport` | onCall | Swath per-property exposure report — quote-first (`confirm:true` required to spend credits), **admin/company_admin gate in-body**, 30-day Firestore cache (integrations/swath.js) |
| `getSwathUsage` | onCall | Swath month-to-date credit meter — **admin/company_admin gate in-body**, 10/hr limiter (integrations/swath.js) |
| `transcribeVoiceMemo` | onCall | Deepgram audio transcription |
| `dictate` | onCall | Whisper unified transcribe + AI cleanup |
| `renderPdf` | onCall | Server-side Puppeteer PDF render (warranty/inspection/estimate/etc.), 2GiB, minInstances:0 since 2026-09-05 — expect a ~10-20s Chromium cold start after an idle window |
| `sendVerificationCode` | onCall | SMS OTP via Twilio Verify (per-phone attempt cap) |
| `verifyCode` | onCall | Verifies a Twilio Verify OTP |
| `notifyNewLead` | onCall | Email + SMS to Joe when a new lead comes in |
| `registerDeviceFingerprint` | onCall | Device-alert integration — registers a device fingerprint, Slack-pings on anomaly |
| `getAiTextingStats` | onCall | T-3 per-rep AI texting analytics (collectionGroup scan over ai_drafts) |
| `previewAiPersona` | onCall | T-4 live persona preview for Settings → AI Texting |
| `resolveAddress` | onCall | D2D address engine — geocode/normalize a knocked address (handlers/geocode.js) |
| `attachStormProof` | onCall | Attaches hail/wind history proof to the caller's lead (handlers/storm-proof.js) |
| `getAdjusterTacticBoard` | onCall | Adjuster tactic board read for the caller's claim (handlers/adjuster-board.js, #1137) |
| `reserveCompanyPrefix` | onCall | Pillar 1 — reserves the tenant's unique customer-ID doc prefix (handlers/provisioning.js, claims-scoped) |
| `sendEmail` | onRequest | Generic Resend email send — ID-token verified + 60/hr/IP rate limit. Per-request `kind` → commercial (default) / transactional; a commercial send to an address on the tenant's email_suppressions register answers 403 `unsubscribed` (503 `suppression_unverified` when the register can't be read), checked BEFORE the limiters; commercial sends get the unsubscribe footer + RFC 8058 List-Unsubscribe headers (functions/email-suppression.js) |
| `sendSMS` | onRequest | Twilio SMS send — ID-token verified, paid-subscription gate, 30/hr/IP + 100/day/uid |
| `sendQueuedSMS` | onRequest | Offline SMS outbox replay endpoint (added 2026-09-18, PR #1675) — the SAME handler as `sendSMS` with `queued` forced on: opt-out first, then a per-uid queued-gate budget (300/hr, 503 `outbox_throttled`), idempotency claim, quiet hours, staleness, tenant-scoped competing activity, lead checks, then sendSMS's gates. Also answers `{ peek: true }` from claims alone (never sends). Separate from `sendSMS` so an old fleet (hosting deployed before functions, a failed functions deploy, a rollback) has no endpoint to serve a replay with: 404 / CORS → the text stays queued |
| `sendD2DSMS` | onRequest | Door-to-door SMS send — ID-token verified + rate limits |
| `createCheckoutSession` | onRequest | Stripe Checkout session (ID-token verified) |
| `createCustomerPortalSession` | onRequest | Stripe billing-portal session (ID-token verified) |
| `getSubscriptionStatus` | onRequest | Reads caller's Stripe subscription status (ID-token verified) |
| `createStripePaymentLink` | onRequest | Stripe payment link for invoices (ID-token verified). Since 2026-09-29 the PLATFORM tenant gets a real, finalized Stripe Invoice instead (stripe-crm-invoice.js — tagged for the Stripe ledger, not emailed by Stripe; off switch `NBD_CRM_STRIPE_INVOICES=off`); Connect tenants still get the destination-charge link |

## PUBLIC (no Firebase auth, compensating controls)

| Export | Type | Compensating control |
|---|---|---|
| `stripeWebhook` | onRequest | Stripe signature verification + idempotency via `stripe_events/{eventId}` |
| `invoiceWebhook` | onRequest | Stripe signature verification (payment_intent.succeeded credit; phase-3 dispute auto-reversal + refund/decline visibility; since 2026-09-29 every event also feeds the Stripe ledger — stripe-ledger.js `onEvent`) |
| `esignWebhook` | onRequest | BoldSign webhook-secret verification |
| `measurementWebhook` | onRequest | Hover/EagleView HMAC + Instant Roofer bearer-token verification; human-report file URLs land here |
| `measureNewWebLead` | onDocumentCreated `leads/{leadId}` | **The only automated spender.** Measures a bridged public estimate lead's roof ($3) once per created lead — gated on `webLead === true`, `publicLeadKind === 'estimate'` and usable coordinates, capped at 25/day, and stoppable without a deploy via `feature_flags/global.webLeadMeasureDisabled` (integrations/public-measure.js) |
| `publicRoofMeasure` | onRequest (public, unauthenticated) | **Read-only — spends nothing.** Hands the /estimate wizard back the homeowner-safe subset of the measurement `measureNewWebLead` took for its lead. 60/hr per IPv6-/64 bucket; returns `{pending:true}` rather than stalling the reveal |

Module helpers re-exported by `Object.assign(exports, …)` and therefore reachable from `index.js`, but NOT deployable functions (the deploy allowlist greps for an `onCall`/`onRequest`/`onDocument*` right-hand side, which these do not have). Shared by `integrations/public-measure.js`: `requestInstantRoofer`, `findReusableMeasurement`, `attachMeasurementToLead` — all from `integrations/measurement.js`.
| `calcomWebhook` | onRequest | Cal.com HMAC verification |
| `swathWebhook` | onRequest | Swath `storm.verified` alerts — Stripe-style HMAC (`t=…,v1=…`, ±300s replay window, fails closed when secret unset), idempotent `storm_events/{id}` ingest + Slack ping |
| `thumbtackWebhook` | onRequest | Thumbtack shared-token verification (Custom Header; Thumbtack offers no HMAC signing) — fails closed when `THUMBTACK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is unset, constant-time compare, 256 KB body cap, idempotent via Thumbtack's event id |
| `thursdayWebhook` | onRequest | Bland post-call webhook for Thursday (AI receptionist) — hex HMAC-SHA256 `X-Webhook-Signature` over the raw body, fails closed (503) when `BLAND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is unset, 1 MB body cap, only Thursday's own inbound number accepted, idempotent via `.create()` on `thursday_calls/bland_calls__{call_id}` (integrations/thursday.js) |
| `thursdayCallerLookup` | onRequest | Live caller lookup for Thursday's pathway greeting — bearer `THURSDAY_LOOKUP_TOKEN` (constant-time), per-IP rate limit, NBD-scoped exact `phoneDigits` match; returns only `{known, first_name, job_hint}` (no address/last name/price) |
| `incomingSMS` | onRequest | Twilio inbound-SMS webhook — X-Twilio-Signature verified (also feeds T-1 AI-texting draft generation) |
| `submitPublicLead` | onRequest | Turnstile token + per-IP rate limit (IPv6 /64) + honeypot + M-04 field allowlist (NO App Check — onRequest can't enforce it, see posture note) |
| `publicVisualizerAI` | onRequest | 5/hr/IP, model locked to Haiku, server-owned prompt, 1.5 MB image cap (NO App Check — see posture note) |
| `publicFunnelAI` | onRequest | Per-IP rate limit; replaces the open `nbd-ai-proxy` CF Worker; Haiku forced, tokens capped, text-only (NO App Check — see posture note) |
| `visualizerImageGen` | onRequest | FLUX.1 Kontext via Replicate, two-tier model selection — `flux-kontext-pro` (~$0.04/call, default for non-shingle edits) / `flux-kontext-max` (~$0.08/call, default for shingle edits: NS/HDZ/UHDZ/Camelot II); gated by `VISUALIZER_IMAGEGEN_ENABLED` (default OFF); **corrected 2026-09-14: 5/hr/IP**, not 15/hr — `visualizer-image-gen.js:645` notes 15/hr was launch-only tuning mode, tightened to 5/hr once quality was confirmed |
| `saveFunnelProgress` | onRequest | Anonymous funnel-step persistence (rate-limited; feeds runAbandonRecovery) |
| `getHomeownerPortalView` | onRequest | Portal token validation, IP rate-limit, length check. 2026-09-25: estimates / e-sign envelopes / invoices found by leadId are kept only if they are the lead's tenant's, and a token of another tenant than the lead's opens nothing (portal-authz.js), because a hard-deleted lead's id can be re-created by anyone and those records are never swept |
| `getPortalDocumentHtml` | onRequest | Portal token; re-derives getHomeownerPortalView's exact generated/sharedWithHomeowner visibility gate server-side per docId (a client can't widen access by guessing one), lead-prefix confinement + 5 MB cap mirroring `getDocumentHtml`'s (documents shelf, 2026-09-16) |
| `getEstimateForView` | onRequest | Portal token validation; stamps first/last-viewed engagement fields. 2026-09-25: the estimate must also be the token's tenant's (portal-authz.js) |
| `uploadHomeownerPhoto` | onRequest | Portal token; 10 photos/lead/day, 8 MB cap, jpeg/png/webp only |
| `uploadPublicLeadPhoto` | onRequest | One-time grant minted by `submitPublicLead` (SHA-256-keyed, 60 min, 10 photos, reserved in a transaction) + per-IP 30/10 min; decoded and re-encoded by sharp (EXIF/GPS dropped, ≤2560px); stored under `homeowner-uploads/` on the bridged CRM lead (2026-09-30) |
| `sendPortalMessage` | onRequest | Portal token; 30 msgs/token/day, 2000-char cap, per-IP limit |
| `getPortalMessages` | onRequest | Portal token; latest 50 messages, marks rep messages read |
| `requestCallback` | onRequest | Portal token; 3 requests/token/day, 280-char note cap, slot whitelist |
| `reportWarrantyClaim` | onRequest | Portal token; 10 reports/IP/min, 2000-char issue-description cap. Creates a `warrantyClaims` triage doc + task/activity; deliberately never touches `lead.stage`/`openWarrantyClaimId` (2026-09-15 Warranty Claim lane) |
| `submitCustomerRating` | onRequest | Portal token; one rating per lead lifetime (write-once), star whitelist |
| `recordCustomerEvent` | onRequest | Portal-token-validated homeowner audit-event capture (which photos/estimates were opened) |
| `getSignDocument` | onRequest | Remote signing: ~120-bit single-use token, 7-day expiry, per-IP rate limit |
| `submitSignature` | onRequest | Remote signing: burns token atomically, signed-HTML size cap, and refuses a submission carrying no signature (noFields vs unsigned) BEFORE the burn |
| `getEsignEnvelope` | onRequest | Envelope signing: ~120-bit single-use token, 14-day expiry, per-IP rate limit. Streams the PDF bytes through the function — the signer never receives a Storage URL. Reports expired / revoked / signed distinctly |
| `submitEsignEnvelope` | onRequest | Envelope signing: stamps a FLATTENED signed PDF with pdf-lib, verifies the source digest is unchanged, requires consent, records signer IP + user agent + both SHA-256 digests. Stamps BEFORE the burn so a bad payload cannot grief a real signing. Never overwrites the source |
| `getDealRoom` | onRequest | Deal acceptance: ~120-bit single-use token, 14-day expiry, served same-origin via `/deal/**` rewrite |
| `submitDealAcceptance` | onRequest | Deal acceptance: burns token, records tier + signature, notifies rep |
| `crmMcp` | onRequest | NBD CRM connection for the Grok Bot team: MCP (JSON-RPC) at `/api/mcp`, per-bot hashed keys, minimized reads, files notes/reminders/reports into `agent_inbox`; no send/edit/delete tools; `AGENT_MCP_DISABLED=true` kills it |
| `createAgentKey` | onCall | Owner/company_admin mints one bot's CRM key (shown once; stored as SHA-256) |
| `listAgentKeys` | onCall | The company's bot keys (no secrets) + bot tool lists |
| `revokeAgentKey` | onCall | Turns one bot key off |
| `dealRoomReadPing` | onRequest | Deal room time-on-page beacon via `/api/deal-read` rewrite: token-authed, adds clamped seconds to deal_rooms.readSeconds; preview bots ignored |
| `getSharedReport` | onRequest | Report share: ~120-bit REUSABLE token, 30-day default expiry, per-IP rate limit (view-only) |
| `getCalendarFeed` | onRequest | Read-only `.ics` feed served at `/calendar/<token>.ics` for the iPhone Calendar app. ~120-bit token, deliberately NO expiry (a subscription that stops refreshing is silent), per-IP + per-token rate limits, `text/calendar`, never an empty 200 — a calendar client reads that as "all events deleted" |
| `emailUnsubscribe` | onRequest | CAN-SPAM unsubscribe at `/unsubscribe/<token>` (hosting rewrite): 256-bit opaque token per commercial send, no expiry. GET = confirm page, NO side effect (link scanners); POST (page button or RFC 8058 one-click) records the per-tenant suppression idempotently. Neutral page for unknown tokens, per-IP rate limit, intentionally public |
| `markEmailUnsubscribed` | onCall | Rep marks a lead's email unsubscribed (source `rep`) — lead owner, same-company company_admin/manager, or platform admin; App Check enforced |
| `resendWebhook` | onRequest | Resend bounce/complaint → the same per-tenant suppression register (sources `bounce`, `complaint`) at `/hooks/resend` (hosting rewrite). Svix/standard-webhooks HMAC, 5-min tolerance, timing-safe; `create()` idempotency on `resend_events/{id}`. Tenant comes from the `nbd_unsub` Resend tag → token doc, never guessed. Only PERMANENT bounces suppress. **DARK until `RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set + the endpoint is added in the Resend dashboard** — unconfigured it answers 503 before parsing |
| `getPublicSiteConfig` | onRequest | Pillar 5 tenant-microsite config read — strict public-marketing whitelist, active-tenant check, rate-limited |
| `submitReferral` | onRequest | Per-IP (5/10min) + per-source-customer (10/24h) rate limit, phone/email validation |
| `stormReport` | onRequest | Public IEM storm-history proxy for /storm-report — server-side yearly chunking + Firestore cache (no API key needed) |
| `getGoogleReviews` | onRequest | Cached Google Places reviews proxy (6-hour Firestore cache; keeps API key server-side); 60/min/IP via `guardHttp` (2026-08-10 — previously the ONLY unlimited public endpoint) |
| `shareSSR` | onRequest | Server-rendered share-link preview HTML with og:/twitter: meta (token-authed lookup) |
| `cspReport` | onRequest | Logs only, no side effects; 60/min/IP (boolean honored 2026-08-10 — was advisory-only) |
| `stripeConnectWebhook` | onRequest | Stripe **Connect** webhook — signature verified (`STRIPE_CONNECT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`), fails closed, dedupes, drops livemode mismatches (handlers/stripe-connect.js) |
| `onRepSignup` | beforeUserCreated | Auth blocker — **corrected 2026-09-14: it IS deployed and active**, not "exported but never deployed" (this row's own §Flags/ambiguities entry above already said so and was right). It is the sole entry in `NBD_DEPLOY_SKIP_LIST` (.github/workflows/firebase-deploy.yml) because the GCIP blocking-function registration 400s on every deploy attempt for it — that failure blocks *updates* to the deployed instance, not its presence; the Firebase CLI's `Deploys failed. Skipping deletes.` behavior means a code-level removal wouldn't reach GCP either. It never actually *fires* in production for the same reason (see `documentation/audit/BLOCKING-TRIGGERS-NOT-GCIP-2026-08-17.md`). Do NOT remove the export; the skip is a retry carve-out, not evidence of absence. |

## ADMIN (role check required)
Verified by the smoke test "every admin function in FUNCTIONS_INDEX has a role/admin gate" which greps the function body for one of: `role === 'admin'`, `adminOnly: true`, `requireTeamAdmin(`, `isAdmin()`.

| Export | Type | Auth gate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `setStorageCors` | onRequest | `requireAuth({ adminOnly: true })` | One-time CORS config |
| `integrationStatus` | onCall | `claims.role === 'admin'` | Integration health check (depends on every integration secret) |
| `getAdminAnalytics` | onCall | `claims.role === 'admin'` | Cross-tenant analytics |
| `getAiUsageAnalytics` | onCall | `claims.role === 'admin'` | Real claudeProxy usage aggregation for /admin/analytics.html (replaces SAMPLE DATA) |
| `rotateAccessCodes` | onCall | `requireTeamAdmin` | Access-code rotation |
| `createTeamMember` | onCall | `requireTeamAdmin` (admin / company_admin / owner) | Team management |
| `createTeamInvite` | onCall | `requireTeamAdmin` | Pillar 4 — server-side invite create so plan seat limits hold |
| `updateUserRole` | onCall | `requireTeamAdmin` | Team management |
| `deactivateUser` | onCall | `requireTeamAdmin` | Team management |
| `removeMember` | onCall | `requireTeamAdmin` + `callerMayManageTarget` | Removes roster doc AND strips companyId/role claims + revokes tokens (fixes claim-persistence hole of client-side delete) |
| `listTeamMembers` | onCall | `requireTeamAdmin` | Team management |
| `assignSeats` | onCall | `requireTeamAdmin` | Pillar 4 — seat assignment across the roster (handlers/invites.js) |
| `setCompanySeatCount` | onCall | `requireTeamAdmin` (**ownerOnly** — non-owner company_admins refused) | Buys/sets the paid seat count via Stripe; seat money is the bill-payer's call alone (handlers/seats.js) |
| `createConnectAccount` | onCall | `requireTeamAdmin` | Stripe Connect — creates the tenant's Express account (handlers/stripe-connect.js) |
| `createConnectOnboardingLink` | onCall | `requireTeamAdmin` | Stripe Connect — mints the hosted-onboarding link |
| `createConnectDashboardLink` | onCall | `requireTeamAdmin` | Stripe Connect — mints the Express-dashboard login link |
| `getConnectStatus` | onCall | `requireTeamAdmin` | Stripe Connect — reads capability/charges state (fail-closed bools) |
| `stripeLedgerSync` | onCall | requireOwner: platform owner, its company_admin, or role admin | Stripe ledger — pulls every charge / invoice / refund / dispute / payout (optionally since N days) into `stripeLedger/` and books matched money onto CRM invoices. `dryRun` defaults to TRUE (functions/stripe-ledger.js) |
| `assignStripeTransaction` | onCall | requireOwner | Stripe ledger — assigns a review-list payment to a customer, books it, remembers the Stripe customer on the lead |
| `getStripeOverview` | onCall | requireOwner | Stripe ledger — balance (available/pending) + last 10 payouts for the Money view |
| `setupGoogleCalendar` | onCall | requireOwner: platform owner, its company_admin, or role admin | Google Calendar — creates the "NBD Jobs" calendar (owned by the functions service account), shares it READ-ONLY with the given Google account, fills it (functions/google-calendar.js) |
| `getGoogleCalendarStatus` | onCall | requireOwner | Google Calendar — set up? shared with whom, the service-account email to share free/busy with, whether Jo's main calendar is readable |
| `getBusyTimes` | onCall | requireOwner | Google Calendar — merged busy blocks (NBD Jobs + Jo's main calendar) for the double-booking warning; ≤62-day window |
| `reverifyCompanyKnocks` | onCall | `requireTeamAdmin` | D2D — re-geocodes/verifies the company's knock addresses (540s sweep) |
| `convertUnmatchedSms` | onCall | `isOwnerCaller` or `role === 'admin'` | Turns an `unmatched_sms` triage row into a real lead + AI draft (handlers/inbound-sms-convert.js) |

Two further exports are admin-gated but deliberately NOT rows in the table above, because the drift-guard smoke test's pattern-window heuristic can't see their gates and would fail CI:

- **adminAI** (onRequest, handlers/ai.js) — verifies a Firebase ID token then requires `ADMIN_AI_ROLES.has(role)` with roles {admin, company_admin, manager}. Claude relay for the admin tools (project-codex assistant, vault session-parsers); model forced to Haiku, 60k-char prompt / 2048-token caps; per-uid + per-IP rate limits via `guardHttp` (rate-limit-policy.js, 2026-08-10).
- **runMigrations** (onCall, migrations/runner.js) — `req.auth?.token?.role !== 'admin'` → permission-denied. Listed in the MIGRATIONS section below. (The smoke test doesn't scan `functions/migrations/`.)

## REP UTILITY (authed but expensive — strong rate limits compensate for lack of admin gate)
These operate on the **caller's own data** (owner-scoped Firestore queries inside the function body), so the rate limit is the real protection, not a role check. If a future change widens their blast radius beyond the caller, they should move to ADMIN.

| Export | Type | Rate limit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `backfillAnalytics` | onCall | 1 / 10 min / uid | Backfills computed fields on caller's leads |

## E2E TEST HELPERS (deployed, but env-gated)
| Export | Type | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| `provisionE2ETestUser` | onCall | E2E env gate + owner claim (`token.owner === true`) with deprecated `OWNER_EMAILS` fallback |
| `cleanupE2ETestData` | onCall | E2E env gate — deletes only the fixed E2E test account's data |

## GDPR / MIGRATIONS (M-01 / M-02)
| Export | Type | Auth gate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `exportMyData` | onCall | Self (authenticated uid) | GDPR Article 20 export |
| `requestAccountErasure` | onCall | Self; 3/24h/uid rate limit | Step 1 of two-step erasure: mints 24h confirmation token, emails account-on-file |
| `confirmAccountErasure` | onRequest | Emailed token (POST body) + per-IP/per-uid rate limits | Step 2: verifies token, cascade delete + Auth disable. GET serves a static confirm page (60/min/IP). Was listed as onCall — it is onRequest. |
| `runMigrations` | onCall | `role === 'admin'` (see ADMIN note) | Manual versioned-migration trigger (was mislabeled "scheduler-triggered" in the previous index) |
| `migrationsTick` | scheduled (every 24h) | n/a (server-only) | Idempotent daily migration cron (also listed in SCHEDULED) |

## SCHEDULED CRONS (server-only, no client traffic) — 28
| Export | Schedule | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `weeklyDigest` | Mon 07:00 ET | Rep recap of previous 7 days; opt-out `users/{uid}.weeklyDigestEnabled === false`; DRY-RUN unless `WEEKLY_DIGEST_ENABLED=true` |
| `dormantLeadNudge` | Wed 08:00 ET | Leads stuck >30 days at non-terminal stages → rep email; opt-out per user; DRY-RUN unless `DORMANT_NUDGE_ENABLED=true` |
| `anniversaryAutoTouch` | daily 08:00 ET | 1-year install-anniversary digest + `anniversary_due` activity write (rep sends the touch, not us — TCPA); DRY-RUN unless `ANNIVERSARY_TOUCH_ENABLED=true` |
| `runAbandonRecovery` | hourly | Funnel-drop recovery email sender; DRY-RUN unless `FUNNEL_RECOVERY_ENABLED=true` |
| `dailyLeadDigest` | daily 07:00 ET | Summary of the last 24h of public leads |
| `leadFollowUpSweep` | every 3h | One follow-up email to 20-48h-old leads whose bridged CRM card is untouched |
| `stormWatch` | every 30 min | NWS/IEM Local Storm Reports watcher; always alerts Joe; subscriber texting gated by `STORM_TEXT_ENABLED` |
| `checkStormAlerts` | every 30 min | (sms-functions.js) Polls NWS **weather alerts** for subscriber zips → Twilio SMS. Distinct from `stormWatch`, which polls storm *reports* |
| `monthlyMarketingReport` | 1st of month 07:00 ET | Marketing rollup email |
| `healthDigestCron` | daily 14:00 UTC | Ops health digest (Vision spend, Stripe webhooks, Anthropic tokens, portal engagement); gated on `HEALTH_DIGEST_ENABLED` |
| `emailQueueWorker` | every 1 min | Drains `email_queue/` via Resend |
| `hailMatchCron` | daily 09:00 | HailTrace/NOAA storm-match sweep + Slack notify — deliberately never uses the Swath provider (a 500-lead sweep would burn the credit budget; see hail-cron.js) (was listed as `hailCron` — actual export name is `hailMatchCron`) |
| `onAppointmentReminder` | every 15 min | Push notification 15 min before appointments |
| `onFollowUpDue` | daily 08:00 | Push notification for due follow-ups |
| `googleCalendarReconcile` | daily 05:45 ET | Google Calendar — makes "NBD Jobs" match the CRM (jobs + adjuster meetings from 30 days back; removes stale events). No-op until set up; kill switch `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_SYNC_DISABLED=true` |
| `stripeLedgerReconcile` | daily 06:15 ET | Stripe ledger — re-ingests the last 4 days of Stripe activity so a missed webhook can never lose a payment (idempotent; kill switch `STRIPE_LEDGER_DISABLED=true`, also honoured by the webhook path) |
| `onYardSignPickupDue` | daily 07:30 ET | Push: yard signs due for pickup today or overdue (one per rep, repeats daily until handled) |
| `migrationsTick` | every 24h | Idempotent versioned-migration runner tick |
| `auditLogRetentionCron` | daily 03:30 | Prunes `audit_log` rows past retention (keys on `ts`) |
| `recordingRetentionCron` | daily 05:00 | Prunes aged voice-intelligence recordings |
| `pdfRenderRetention` | daily 04:20 ET | Prunes server-rendered PDFs under `pdf-renders/{uid}/` past 30 days. Renders are derived artifacts (the Firestore row is the system of record) and the prefix previously grew forever with no rule block and no reaper; 19 of 21 prod objects carried a permanent download token that answered an unauthenticated GET, and deleting the object is the only revocation a token has (pdf-render-retention.js) |
| `dailyFirestoreBackup` | daily 03:15 ET | Full Firestore export to `gs://nobigdeal-pro-firestore-backups/YYYY-MM-DD/` (firestore-backup.js) |
| `firestoreBackupRetention` | daily 03:45 ET | Prunes backups older than 30 days (firestore-backup.js) |
| `backupFreshnessCron` | daily 06:00 ET | **The alarm for the above.** Emails if no `overall_export_metadata` newer than 26h is in the backup bucket. No enable-gate on purpose (backup-freshness.js) |
| `enforceLapsedSeats` | daily 09:00 | Pillar 4 — deactivates members past their seat lapse grace window (lapse-enforcement.js) |
| `reviewRequestNudge` | daily 08:15 ET | Google-review request nudge emails for recently-won jobs (review-request-nudge.js) |
| `morningBrief` | daily 06:45 ET | Today's appointments (Cal.com bookings, job days, other jobs, adjuster meetings) with CRM property history → ONE email to the owner (`NBD_OWNER_UID`), never a homeowner; nothing today → no send; opt-out `users/{owner}.morningBriefEnabled === false`; DRY-RUN unless `MORNING_BRIEF_ENABLED=true` (morning-brief.js / morning-brief-logic.js) |
| `callCenterIngest` | every 30 min ET | Lists the "Cube ACR" Drive folder Jo shared with the functions service account (drive.readonly) and files each new call recording as `phone_calls/cube_<driveId>` on the owner tenant: lead matched by phone, bucket customer / insurance / contact / unknown, audio to private Storage `calls/{owner}/cube-acr/`; 90-day first backfill, 40 files a run, cursor + counts on `integrations/callCenter` (`paused: true` stops it); DRY-RUN (counts only) unless `CALL_CENTER_INGEST_ENABLED=true` (call-center.js / call-center-logic.js) |
| `callCenterTranscribe` | every 30 min ET | Stored `phone_calls` → Groq Whisper transcript (Voice Intelligence's helper/key; ≤ 25 MB, ≤ 7.5 h audio a day, 12 a run, newest first, 3 tries) → Claude Haiku notes (summary, who promised what, follow-up date, urgent) → `leads/{id}/activity/cube-{id}` + ONE create-only follow-up task `leads/{id}/tasks/cube-{id}` when Jo promised something; a "personal" call keeps no transcript and files nothing; respects the AI kill switch; OFF unless `CALL_CENTER_TRANSCRIBE_ENABLED=true`, except ids on `integrations/callCenter.transcribeOnly` (cleared after they run) (call-center.js / call-center-logic.js) |
| `callCenterSweep` | 07:15 + 15:15 ET | "You said you'd…" email to the owner (`users/{owner}.email`), INTERNAL: noted `phone_calls` from the last 30 days with an open cube task due today or earlier, an urgent call in the last 36 h, or no customer on file with Jo's promise / a follow-up date that has come; handled calls skipped; nothing open → nothing sent; DRY-RUN unless `CALL_CENTER_SWEEP_ENABLED=true` (call-center.js / call-center-logic.js) |
| `callWatch` | every 2 h, 08:00–20:00 ET | The call check Jo asked for (2026-10-02): anything NEW since the last check that needs Jo — `phone_calls` / `phone_text_days` by the Calls screen's own `callNeedsYou` rule (urgent, Jo's promise, follow-up due, insurance line or unknown number with no customer, missed inbound) and Thursday calls processed but not reviewed — plus pipeline health (copy / transcribe not run in 75 min or failed, calls waiting 6+ h for a transcript, Thursday stuck 30+ min or failed today, text backups once text notes are on). ONE bell notification (`notifications`, type `call_watch`, opens #/calls) + a push to Jo; nothing new → nothing; a standing problem repeats at most every 6 h; never SMS or email; state in `integrations/callWatch`; a failure throws so the heartbeat reports /fail; DRY-RUN unless `CALL_WATCH_ENABLED=true` (call-watch.js / call-watch-logic.js) | Also reads Twilio delivery results (GET only, secrets TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID/AUTH_TOKEN): texts the carrier blocked raise "texts are not delivering" at most daily (2026-10-02: 0 of 23 delivered while records said sent).
| `textInboxIngest` | every 30 min ET | Newest `sms-*.xml` from the "SMSBackupRestore" Drive folder Jo shared with the functions service account (drive.readonly) → `phone_texts` (received + sent SMS/MMS, content-hash ids, lead matched by phone, bucket customer / insurance / contact / unknown; short codes never stored); same file twice → no-op; cursor − 3 days overlap, 90-day first run; counts only on `integrations/textInbox` (`paused: true` stops it); DRY-RUN unless `TEXT_INBOX_ENABLED=true` (text-inbox.js / text-inbox-logic.js) |
| `textInboxNotes` | every 60 min ET | The last 3 days of `phone_texts` grouped into conversation-days (one number, one ET day; group texts skipped); each day quiet for 2 h whose signature changed → Claude Haiku notes (same shape and sanitizer as calls) → `phone_text_days/txt_<digits>_<ymd>`, a customer timeline entry `leads/{id}/activity/sms-{dayId}` and, for days within 14 days, ONE create-only task `leads/{id}/tasks/sms-{dayId}` when Jo promised something; personal days file nothing; 30 days a run; `callCenterSweep` reads these alongside calls; AI kill switch; DRY-RUN unless `TEXT_NOTES_ENABLED=true` (text-inbox.js / text-inbox-logic.js) |
| `syncGbpReviews` | daily 06:00 ET | Pulls Google Business Profile reviews into the reviews widget cache (gbp-reviews-sync.js) |
| `monthlyOverheadAlertCron` | 1st of month 09:00 | Emails the overhead-vs-margin summary for the month just ended (monthly-overhead-alert.js) |

## FIRESTORE / STORAGE TRIGGERS (no direct client traffic) — 38 Firestore + 2 Storage
| Export | Watches | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `onPhotoUploaded` | Storage finalize (`nobigdeal-pro.appspot.com`) | 200/600/1600 px WebP variant pipeline; stamps `photo.urls` (or `knock.photoVariants[idx]` for `/d2d/` sources, mirrored to the converted lead) |
| `onKnockCreated` | `knocks/{knockId}` created | Race-heal for d2d photo variants: photos upload BEFORE the knock doc exists, so early photos' Storage triggers miss — this stamps `photoVariants` for any `photoPaths` entry whose variants already exist (tokens recovered from variant object metadata) |
| `onAudioUploaded` | Storage finalize (`nobigdeal-pro.firebasestorage.app`) | Voice intelligence — recording → transcribe + analyze (was listed as `voiceIntelligenceTrigger`). 2026-09-25: ignores `audio/{uid}/d2d/...` and other reserved lead ids, which used to land every D2D memo under one phantom `leads/d2d` |
| `jobsOnJobWrite` | `leads/{leadId}/jobs/{jobId}` written | Multi-job stage 2b (2026-09-30): when the customer's active job is done (closed out AND paid in full, or lost — Jo J3) and another job is open, the OLDEST open job becomes the active one (its fields copied onto the lead + `activeJobId`). Same check also runs inside `jobsMirrorOnLead`. Idempotent; gated by `JOBS_MIRROR_ENABLED` |
| `jobsMirrorOnLead` | `leads/{leadId}` written | A customer can have more than one job, phase 1 (2026-09-30). Keeps `leads/{id}/jobs/{activeJobId}` in step with the lead's own per-job fields (stage, value, schedule, claim…). Creates `jobs/j1` and sets `activeJobId` on a lead that has none. Loop-safe (its own write is a no-op the second time). Never throws on a lead write. **Off until enabled:** runs only with `JOBS_MIRROR_ENABLED=true` in `functions/.env.nobigdeal-pro` (Jo's go-ahead; it writes to live leads). Plan: `documentation/projects/CRM-JOBS-AND-MONEY-PAPER-PLAN-2026-09-30.md` |
| `moneyPaperOnInvoice` | `invoices/{invoiceId}` written | Every charge gets a filed document, NBD tenant only (2026-09-30). Files an NBD-500 invoice PDF when a Stripe invoice is attached, and an NBD-510 receipt once the invoice is paid in full, as `documents/<owner>/<lead>/<NBD-YYYY-MMDD-XXXX>.pdf` plus a `leads/{id}/documents` row. A Mark-Paid payoff marks the open Stripe invoice `paid_out_of_band`, after recording the ledger key `<in_id>:oob` so stripe-ledger never double-credits it. Claims are transactional, and there are 3 attempts. Kill switch: `NBD_MONEY_PAPER=off` |
| `onNewLead` | `leads/{leadId}` created | Push notification to assigned rep |
| `onLeadCalendarWrite` | `leads/{leadId}` written | Google Calendar — updates that lead's "NBD Jobs" events (job + adjuster meeting) when a field the calendar shows changes; platform tenant only; no-op until set up (functions/google-calendar.js) |
| `onJobCalendarWrite` | `leads/{leadId}/jobs/{jobId}` written | Google Calendar — multi-job: a customer's OTHER (non-active) job gets its own "NBD Jobs" events, keyed per job, titled with the job; the active job's events stay the lead's; platform tenant only; no-op until set up (functions/google-calendar.js) |
| `onYardSignCalendarWrite` | `yardSigns/{signId}` written | Google Calendar — a yard sign's pickup reminder: one all-day FREE "🪧 Pick up yard sign" event on its New York pickup day (overdue → rolled to today by the nightly reconcile), removed on pickup / missing / remove; platform tenant only; no-op until set up (functions/google-calendar.js) |
| `onKnockCalendarWrite` | `knocks/{knockId}` written | Google Calendar — D2D follow-ups that carry a time: the NEWEST knock at a door decides (Jo, 2026-09-30) — a 30-minute BUSY "📞 Follow up" event keyed per door, removed when the newest knock has no timed follow-up; spelling variants merged by the nightly reconcile; platform tenant only; no-op until set up (functions/google-calendar.js) |
| `onClaimStageChange` | `leads/{leadId}` updated | Push notification on claim-stage transitions |
| `onAiDraftApproved` | `leads/{leadId}/ai_drafts/{draftId}` updated | Sends approved AI-drafted SMS via Twilio (pending→approved transition only; idempotent) |
| `estimateEmail` | `estimate_leads/{id}` created | Emails homeowner their estimate on `email_estimate_request`; LIVE by default (2026-07-18), `ESTIMATE_EMAIL_ENABLED=false` forces DRY-RUN |
| `stormReportEmail` | `inspect_leads/{leadId}` created | Homeowner follow-up email for /storm-report leads |
| `teamInviteEmail` | `companies/{companyId}/members/{memberId}` created | Sends the invite email when a roster invite doc is created |
| `leadAlertContact` / `leadAlertEstimate` / `leadAlertFreeRoof` / `leadAlertInspect` / `leadAlertStorm` | `contact_leads` / `estimate_leads` / `free_roof_entries` / `inspect_leads` / `storm_alert_subscribers` created | Text + email Joe the moment a public marketing lead lands |
| `leadAlertCalcom` | `leads/{leadId}` created | Text + email Joe for two kinds of lead create. (1) The Cal.com webhook's booking lead (`publicLeadKind: 'calcom_booking'` + `webLead: true`); a `needsPhone` booking leads with a NO PHONE row/line. (2) Since 2026-09-26, `leadBridgeThumbtack`'s mirror (`publicLeadKind: 'thumbtack'`), only when the doc id is the bridge's own `thumbtack_leads__<publicLeadId>`. Nothing alerts on `thumbtack_leads` itself. Manual, web-form-bridged and backfilled leads return early. No homeowner ack. Name kept: renaming would deploy a second trigger beside the old one |
| `leadBridgeContact` / `leadBridgeEstimate` / `leadBridgeFreeRoof` / `leadBridgeInspect` / `leadBridgeStorm` | same five collections | Mirror each high-intent public lead into the tenant's CRM `leads` pipeline (tenant-aware, idempotent) |
| `leadBridgeThumbtack` | `thumbtack_leads/{leadId}` | Mirror a Thumbtack webhook lead into the CRM pipeline. Source reads `Thumbtack` (not `Website — …`) so marketplace spend is attributed to the channel; Thumbtack **test** deliveries are stored but never bridged |
| `slack_onLeadWon` | `leads/{leadId}` written | Slack ping on won deal |
| `onReferralLeadWrite` | `leads/{leadId}` written | Referral-code redemption: attribute a redeemed `redeemReferralCode` to its referrer, then record the $100 bonus as OWED + notify the rep when the referred project reaches a closed stage — once per JOB since 2026-09-30 (J1; latch on the job doc; a customer's first job paid under the old per-customer rule is never paid again) |
| `onReferralJobWrite` | `leads/{leadId}/jobs/{jobId}` written | Referral bonus for a referred customer's OTHER (non-active) job when it closes — one more $100 owed per won job (J1); same per-job latch (functions/referral-rewards.js) |
| `slack_onStormAlert` | `storm_alerts_sent/{id}` created | Slack ping on storm alert |
| `slack_onAdminGrantAttempt` | `audit_log/{id}` created | Slack ping on admin-grant attempts (was collectively listed as `slackPing`, which no longer exists) |
| `stormBriefing_onAlertSent` | `storm_alerts_sent/{id}` created | Phase B.2 rep-facing storm briefing (call-order scoring; once per alertId via atomic sentinel) |
| `audit_users` / `audit_leads` / `audit_companies` / `audit_company_members` / `audit_access_codes` / `audit_subscriptions` | respective collections, written | H-4 canonical audit_log writers (PII-redacted compact diffs, stamp `ts` for retention). Was collectively listed as `auditTriggers` |
| `auditInvoices` | `invoices/{invoiceId}` written | audit-log.js — the only live writer left in that module (`invoices/*` is not covered by audit-triggers.js) |
| `auditUsers` / `auditCompanies` / `auditAccessCodes` / `auditSubscriptions` | (no-ops) | **Retained dead exports** from audit-log.js — superseded by `audit_*` on 2026-06-08. Kept because the name-scoped CI deploy cannot prune orphaned functions; deleting the exports would leave old double-writing revisions live. Remove via `firebase functions:delete ...` when prod access allows. |
| `onPortalMessageDraft` | `leads/{leadId}/portal_messages/{msgId}` created | T-series — AI reply draft for an inbound homeowner portal message (source:'homeowner' only; safe-dark when secret unset) |
| `voiceConsumer` | `leads/{leadId}/recordings/{recordingId}` written | Turns a completed call recording's structured summary into lead field updates (voice-consumer.js) |
| `thursdayCallProcess` | `thursday_calls/{docId}` written (status `pending`/`reprocess`, claimed in a transaction) | Thursday call pipeline: hydrate from Bland, copy recording to Storage, Claude extraction, NBD-scoped lead match, route (create lead / attach / possible match / inbox / log only), task + activity, email/push/Bland-SMS notify — idempotent per step (integrations/thursday.js) |
| `onEstimateViewedStrike` | `customerAuditEvents/{eventId}` created | Engagement scoring — estimate-view strike counter for the almost-there widget (customer-audit.js) |
| `onLeadDeleted` | `leads/{leadId}` deleted | Reaps the lead's Storage artifacts (`documents/` `portals/` `galleries/` `audio/` under `{uid}/{leadId}/`), its orphaned `documents` subcollection, and its outstanding `portal_tokens` / `doc_sign_tokens`. Hard-deleting a lead previously removed the Firestore doc and nothing else, leaving customer-facing HTML live under a permanent download token with the only pointer to it destroyed (10 prod orphans, 2026-08-18). Fires on hard delete only — the trash bin is `deleted: true` and must keep its artifacts (lead-artifact-cleanup.js). 2026-09-25: also deletes the lead's WHOLE Firestore subtree (every subcollection found with `listCollections()`, nested ones included, each row's Storage objects before the row, rows newer than the delete kept for a lead re-created at the same id), because whoever re-created a deleted lead's id owned its leftover rows (lead-subtree-sweep.js; documentation/audit/LEAD-SUBTREE-HIJACK-2026-09-25.md). Review of that change, same day: also deletes top-level `/notes` naming the lead; tokens, `/photos`, `/notes` and appointments run before the subtree walk; every step keeps docs newer than the delete and only a same-tenant re-create may keep old docs it wrote to; a reserved lead id (`d2d`, `_variants`, ...) revokes tokens and nothing else; row-supplied uids no longer widen the `/photos` confinement and reach the Storage-prefix step only if they are in the lead's tenant |

## TEST-ONLY / HELPER EXPORTS (19 — NOT Cloud Functions, never deployed)
Exported for unit tests or internal reuse; they carry no `__endpoint` and Firebase deploy ignores them.

- `_test` (storm-watch.js and integrations/storm-briefing.js each export one), `_constants`, `_bridgeCollections` (lead-bridge.js)
- `lookupHail` — plain async hail-history helper (integrations/hail.js) shared by `getHailHistory` + `attachStormProof` (handlers/storm-proof.js); not a Cloud Function. (2026-08-06 correction: previously said "storm briefing", but storm-briefing.js never imports it.)
- Swath helpers `fetchSwathHail` / `querySwathProperty` / `verifySwathSignature` / `_test` — module exports of integrations/swath.js consumed by hail.js, parcel.js, and tests/smoke/swath-signature.test.js. Deliberately NOT mounted on index.js (it mounts the three Swath Cloud Functions selectively).
- Voice-intelligence internals: `_VoiceError`, `_analyzeTranscript`, `_checkBudget`, `_checkVerbalConsent`, `_getCompanyContext`, `_incrementVoiceUsage`, `_parseAudioPath`, `_processRecording`, `_transcribeAudio`
- Push-notification helpers (plain async functions): `sendTeamNotification`, `sendStreakNotification`, `sendCustomNotification`
- Slack helper: `postSlack`
- **Dead keys**: `sendPushNotification` and `getUserFCMTokens` are exported from push-functions.js as `undefined` (its `module.exports` references `exports.sendPushNotification` / `exports.getUserFCMTokens`, which are never assigned). Harmless to deploy, but they should be removed from the export map.

---

## Flags / ambiguities (2026-07-04 refresh)

1. **Two overlapping Firestore backup pipelines**: `dailyFirestoreBackup` + `firestoreBackupRetention` (functions/firestore-backup.js, 03:15/03:45 ET → `gs://nobigdeal-pro-firestore-backups`, 30-day retention) AND `nightlyFirestoreBackup` (integrations/compliance.js "D5", 04:00 CT → `gs://nobigdeal-pro-backups`, no retention job). Both are deployed. Consolidation candidate.

   **UPDATE 2026-09-03 — neither had ever run, and only one is worth fixing.** Both destination buckets were missing, and the runtime SA holds `roles/editor`, which deliberately excludes `datastore.databases.export`. The `dailyFirestoreBackup` pipeline is now WORKING: `gs://nobigdeal-pro-firestore-backups` created (US multi-region — the docstring's `us-central1` is wrong for this `nam5` database), `roles/datastore.importExportAdmin` granted, first real export verified with its `overall_export_metadata` marker.

   `nightlyFirestoreBackup` was deliberately left broken. Its bucket `gs://nobigdeal-pro-backups` was NOT created, because it has **no retention job** — creating it would grow unbounded forever, and it duplicates a pipeline that already works and already prunes. **Retire it rather than fix it.** Until then it errors nightly, which `backupFreshnessCron` correctly ignores: that alarm watches the artifact in the working bucket, not the function logs.

   **DONE 2026-09-05 — retired.** The export was deleted from `integrations/compliance.js`; only one Firestore backup pipeline remains (`dailyFirestoreBackup` + `firestoreBackupRetention`), so this is no longer an ambiguity. Two caveats worth carrying:
   - The function is **still deployed**. The Firebase CLI prints `Deploys failed. Skipping deletes.` whenever any function in a run fails, and `onRepSignup` fails every deploy by design (`NBD_DEPLOY_SKIP_LIST`), so a code deletion does not reach GCP on its own. It and its Cloud Scheduler job need a manual delete; `nightlyFirestoreBackup` is carried in `ALLOW_ORPHANS` in `scripts/check-function-orphans.js` until then, and **that entry should be removed once GCP is actually clean**.
   - It was the only place in `functions/` that took an ADC token from `google-auth-library` and called a Google REST API with `fetch` — the pattern [WAVE2-IMPLEMENTATION-MAPS-2026-09-05](../documentation/audit/WAVE2-IMPLEMENTATION-MAPS-2026-09-05.md) cites for the GA4 Data API and Search Console. It now lives only in git history; the retirement note in `compliance.js` says how to retrieve it.
2. **`checkStormAlerts` vs `stormWatch`** both run every 30 minutes in the storm domain but are distinct: `checkStormAlerts` polls NWS *forecast alerts* per subscriber zip; `stormWatch` polls IEM *Local Storm Reports* (observed hail/wind/tornado).
3. **`verify-functions-company-enhancement.js`** defines its own `notifyNewLead` but is **not required by index.js** — dead file; the deployed `notifyNewLead` comes from verify-functions.js.
4. `getRecording` (listed in the 2026-05-13 index) is no longer exported; voice-intelligence's manual kicks (`triggerProcessRecording` / `reprocessRecording`) were retired 2026-08-11. `dunningEmailQueue` and `voiceMemoTrigger` from the old index also no longer exist as exports.
5. ~~`enforceAppCheck: true` is set on many `onRequest` options~~ — **resolved 2026-08-02 (#1170)**: the option is silently ignored on `onRequest` (onCall-only in firebase-functions), so it was removed from every onRequest export. The handler-body gates (ID token / signature / rate limit) were always the real control and remain.

## Maintenance

Adding a new export?

1. Pick the category above and list it.
2. Admin-only exports MUST have one of:
   - `request.auth.token.role === 'admin'` check in the handler
   - `requireAuth(req, { adminOnly: true })` for `onRequest`
   - `requireTeamAdmin(...)` for team-scoped admin
3. The smoke test `admin functions enforce role check` (see `tests/smoke.test.js`) greps for that string in the function body. If you add an admin export without a check, CI will fail.
3b. A second smoke tripwire (`every index.js export appears in FUNCTIONS_INDEX`) fails CI whenever an export reachable from index.js — directly or via one level of `Object.assign(exports, require(...))` — has no mention in this file. Add the row in the same PR as the export.
4. Quick re-enumeration: `cd functions && GCLOUD_PROJECT=nobigdeal-pro FIREBASE_CONFIG='{"projectId":"nobigdeal-pro","storageBucket":"nobigdeal-pro.appspot.com"}' node -e "console.log(Object.keys(require('./index.js')).join('\n'))"` (exports with `__endpoint` are deployable functions; the rest are helpers).
