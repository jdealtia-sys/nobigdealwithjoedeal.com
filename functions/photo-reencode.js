/**
 * photo-reencode.js — the one server-side re-encode for photos the PUBLIC
 * sends us (website lead-form photos, homeowner portal uploads).
 *
 * Decoding and re-encoding with sharp does three jobs at once:
 *   - proves the bytes are a real image (anything else throws → refuse it);
 *   - drops ALL metadata, EXIF incl. GPS — sharp writes none unless asked
 *     (.withMetadata / .keepExif), and we never ask;
 *   - bakes the EXIF orientation into the pixels (.rotate() with no angle)
 *     BEFORE the orientation tag is dropped, so a phone photo doesn't come
 *     out sideways — and caps the long edge at MAX_EDGE.
 *
 * Extracted 2026-10-03 from public-lead-photos.js so the homeowner portal
 * upload (functions/portal.js uploadHomeownerPhoto) uses the identical
 * pipeline: SECURITY-CHECKLIST-2026-10-01 "Open" #2 — portal photos used to
 * be stored byte-for-byte as posted, EXIF/GPS and all.
 *
 * sharp is required lazily so modules that load this one still deploy/test
 * where sharp's prebuilt binary is absent (same pattern as image-pipeline.js).
