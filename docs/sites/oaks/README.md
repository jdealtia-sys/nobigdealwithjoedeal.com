# Oaks Roofing & Construction — website

A complete, self-contained static website. No build step, no framework, no
server code. Every file you need is in this folder.

Built 2026-08-19 as a rebuild of the previous oaksroofingandconstruction.com,
reconstructed from archived copies of the old pages.

## How to put it online

Upload the **contents of this folder** to your host's web root (often called
`public_html`, `www`, or just the site root). That's it — `index.html` becomes
your home page.

It works on essentially anything: cPanel/shared hosting, Netlify, Cloudflare
Pages, GitHub Pages, Vercel, S3, or a plain Apache/nginx box. Nothing needs to
be installed or configured.

Every link inside the site is **relative**, so the folder works at a domain
root or inside a subfolder without editing anything.

## Two things to do before launch

### The quote form — already connected

The form appears on Home, About, Service Areas and Contact, and it is wired to
**scott@oaksroofingandconstruction.com**. When someone presses *Send Message*,
their own mail app opens with every field filled in and addressed to you; they
press send and it lands in your inbox. No account, no monthly fee, nothing to
set up, and the details never pass through anyone else's system.

The one weak spot: a visitor on a desktop with no mail app configured (someone
who only uses webmail in a browser) may see nothing happen. The form tells them
so and points them at the phone number, but that lead needs the phone.

If that becomes a real problem, switch to a form relay — one line in
**`assets/js/site.js`**:

```js
formEndpoint: 'https://formsubmit.co/ajax/scott@oaksroofingandconstruction.com',
```

FormSubmit will email you a one-time activation link the first time someone
submits; until you click it nothing is relayed. `formEndpoint` overrides
`formEmail` when both are set. **If you do switch, update the "Third parties"
section of `privacy.html`** — it currently tells visitors their details are not
routed through an outside service, which would stop being true.

### 1. Turn on search engines

Every page currently carries this line in its `<head>`, which tells Google to
**stay away**:

```html
<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
```

That is deliberate — it stops this copy competing with your real site while it
is staged. **Delete that line from all 11 pages when you go live.**

While you're in each `<head>`, uncomment the two lines below it and swap
`https://example.com` for your real domain:

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/...">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://example.com/...">
```

Those control which URL Google treats as official, and what shows up when
someone shares a link on Facebook or in a text message.

### 2. Check the Privacy Policy

`privacy.html` is an honest, plain-English description of what this site
actually does (a form, no trackers, no cookies beyond one that remembers you
closed the top banner) and how the form delivers. Have someone you trust read it
before launch.

It points people at the phone number for a deletion request rather than at your
email address, so the address is not sitting on a page for spam bots to scrape.
Say the word if you'd rather it were listed there and on the Contact page.

## Editing content

Everything is plain HTML — open a page in any text editor and the words are
right there. Some notes:

- **Phone number** appears in several places per page. It's written twice each
  time: once as visible text `(513) 827-5297`, once as a link
  `tel:+15138275297`. Change both.
- **Colors and fonts** are all at the top of `assets/css/site.css` under
  `:root`. The brand orange is `#fa6404`, taken from your logo.
- **Photos** live in `assets/img/`. Most are saved twice — a `.webp` (smaller,
  modern browsers) and a `.jpg` (fallback). If you replace a photo, replace both,
  or delete the `<source>` line and keep only the `.jpg`.
- **`logo-white.png`** is not used by any page. It's the all-white version of your
  logo, recovered alongside the orange one — keep it for dark photos, shirts,
  vehicle wraps, or anywhere the orange wordmark won't read.
- **The header, footer and top banner** are copied into every page rather than
  shared from one file. That's what makes the site work anywhere with no build
  step — the trade-off is that a change to the menu must be made in all 11
  pages. Search-and-replace across files handles it.
- **The service-area map** (`assets/img/service-area-map.jpg`) is an image, not
  a live map. Replace it if your coverage changes.
- **`404.html`** is what visitors see if they mistype an address or follow a dead
  link. Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, Vercel and most cPanel/Apache
  setups pick it up automatically — nothing to configure. It is deliberately
  self-contained (its styling and logo are inside the file) because a 404 gets
  served in place of *any* missing address, at any depth, so it cannot rely on
  the shared stylesheet the way the other pages do. It offers the phone number
  rather than a "back to homepage" link, for the same reason.

## Adding gallery photos

In `gallery.html`, copy one `<button>` block and point it at your new image.
Each tile needs a full-size file and a cropped thumbnail:

```html
<button type="button" data-full="assets/img/NEW.jpg" data-alt="What the photo shows">
  <picture>
    <source srcset="assets/img/NEW-thumb.webp" type="image/webp">
    <img src="assets/img/NEW-thumb.jpg" alt="What the photo shows" width="760" height="570" loading="lazy">
  </picture>
</button>
```

Thumbnails are 760×570. The lightbox picks up new tiles automatically.

## Notes

- The site needs no JavaScript to be readable. JS only powers the mobile menu,
  the gallery lightbox, the "Load More" areas button, and the form.
- All content and photography came from your previous site. No claims, prices,
  warranties, or credentials were invented — the only figures used are the ones
  the old site published (5-year labor warranty, 30-year shingle warranty,
  50-year siding warranty, 5.0/5.0 from 13 customers).
- Tested at desktop, tablet and phone widths, in light and dark system themes.
