/**
 * NBDPhotoQueueStore — durable IndexedDB backing for PhotoEngine's offline
 * photo upload queue.
 *
 * ── Why this exists as its own store ────────────────────────────────────
 * photo-engine.js queued failed uploads in `state.uploadQueue`, a plain
 * in-memory array. dashboard-sw-bootstrap.js reloads the page on every
 * `pageshow` with event.persisted — i.e. every iOS bfcache resume, which is
 * precisely what happens when a rep backgrounds the app on a roof. So the
 * memory queue was destroyed in exactly the situation it existed for.
 *
 * ── Why NOT offline-manager.js's queue ──────────────────────────────────
 * offline-manager.js already ships a complete IndexedDB write queue, and it
 * has zero callers. It was tempting. It is the wrong shape for photos, on
 * four counts, each of which is a bug and not a style preference:
 *
 *   1. Its flush path is `performFirestoreWrite(item, token)` — a Firestore
 *      REST call built from `item.url`/`item.method`/`item.data`. A photo is
 *      a Storage upload followed by a Firestore doc write. Reusing the queue
 *      means branching its flusher on item type, i.e. two unrelated
 *      protocols sharing one drain loop.
 *   2. Its cap is `MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 500`, and its own comment states the
 *      sizing assumption: "500 items at ~2KB each ~= 1MB". A high-res photo
 *      is ~1.2MB *after* resizeImage(). 500 of those is ~600MB — the cap
 *      would never fire before the browser threw QuotaExceededError, which
 *      is the exact silent-loss failure the cap was written to prevent.
 *   3. It shares DB `nbd-offline-db` / store `pending-writes` with sw.js's
 *      `flushOfflineQueue()`, which replays every record in that store as
 *      `fetch(item.url, { method, body })` and deletes it on completion. A
 *      photo record has no meaningful `url`. That path is currently dead
 *      (sw.js:152 returns early on non-GET, and nothing registers SYNC_TAG
 *      'nbd-sync-queue'), but writing photos into a store another component
 *      believes it owns is a live grenade for whoever revives it.
 *   4. It is not loaded on dashboard.html, and loading it there would add a
 *      second `controllerchange` handler that force-reloads the page, on top
 *      of dashboard-sw-bootstrap.js's own. Two independent reload drivers
 *      with separate guard flags, on a page whose reload behaviour already
 *      has a documented history of looping.
 *
 * So: separate DB, separate store, caps sized for image blobs, and a drain
 * that belongs to PhotoEngine. offline-manager.js is left untouched.
 *
 * ── The durability contract: resolved means COMMITTED ───────────────────
 * A resolved add()/remove()/clear() means the transaction reached
 * `oncomplete`. Not "the request fired success". The distinction is the
 * whole guarantee: in Chromium and Firefox the storage-quota check runs at
 * COMMIT, so a put near quota fires `success` with a fresh id and then the
 * transaction aborts with QuotaExceededError — a module resolving on the
 * request would report a photo as durable that was never written, and the
 * next boot's detectLoss() would then blame the browser for "clearing" it.
 * Every write here awaits the transaction, rejects on abort with the abort's
 * reason, and derives the localStorage counter from a count() issued INSIDE
 * that same transaction, so the counter can never describe rows that do not
 * exist.
 *
 * ── Records hold ArrayBuffers, not Blobs ────────────────────────────────
 * IndexedDB can store Blobs directly, and doing so would be less code. But
 * WebKit has a long history of Blob-in-IDB references going unreadable after
 * the browser restarts — the file is gone, the record isn't. Surviving a
 * restart is this module's entire purpose, so records hold a structured-clone
 * of the raw bytes plus a mime string, and the Blob is rebuilt on read.
 *
 * ── Records are owned ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every record carries the `uid` that captured it, and add() refuses a record
 * without one. The drain uploads only the signed-in user's rows. On a shared
 * device, a rep who signs out with photos still held must not have them
 * uploaded under the next rep's account and company; the rows wait for their
 * owner to sign back in.
 *
 * ── Durability caveats we do NOT paper over ─────────────────────────────
 * We ask for `navigator.storage.persist()`, which on WebKit exempts the
 * origin from the 7-day eviction that clears IDB for unused PWAs. It can be
 * refused. If it is refused, storage is still far more durable than a page
 * reload — which is the case that actually loses photos today.
 *
 * Exposed as window.NBDPhotoQueueStore. Reads resolve to `null` (not 0, not
 * []) when storage is unusable, because a 0 is a positive statement callers
 * act on; writes reject with a `reason` the caller can turn into honest copy.

   * Compare the surviving localStorage counter against the real row count.
   * A positive counter with an EMPTY store means the browser evicted our
   * data. Returns the number of rows lost (0 when nothing was lost), so the
   * caller can tell the rep rather than letting it pass unnoticed.
   *
   * WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SEE — read before trusting a 0.
   * It sees a PARTIAL eviction, where the object store is reclaimed and the
   * counter survives. It is blind by construction to a full site-data clear
   * (WebKit's 7-day ITP purge, "Clear History and Website Data"), because
   * those take localStorage and IndexedDB together and there is then nothing
   * left on the device to compare against. A 0 from here means "no loss that
   * this device can still prove", never "no loss". photo-queue-recovery.js
   * covers the full-wipe case from the server side.
   *
   * Two readings must NOT be collapsed into "the queue was empty":
   * - an ABSENT counter (lastKnownCount() === null). This used to come back
   *   as 0 from a 0-defaulting read and return at the first line, which is
   *   exactly how the wipe above became silent.
   * - a count() that FAILED. Reporting phantom loss would be bad, but
   *   persisting the 0 it implied would be worse — every later boot would
   *   take the counter's fast path and never open the database that still
   *   holds the photos.
