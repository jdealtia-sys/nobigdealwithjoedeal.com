/**
 * Photo queue boot recovery.
 *
 * Persisting the offline photo queue (photo-queue-store.js) is only half a
 * fix. photo-engine.js is lazy-loaded — it arrives with ScriptLoader's
 * `photos` bundle, which loads when the rep opens a photos view. So a photo
 * that survives the reload still uploads nothing until the rep happens to
 * navigate back to photos. On a roof, after a bfcache resume, that is not a
 * safe assumption to build a promise on.
 *
 * This module closes the loop: on every dashboard boot, if the durable queue
 * has rows, it waits for Firebase auth, pulls in the photos bundle, and asks
 * PhotoEngine to drain. The rep does nothing.
 *
 * It is deliberately separate from photo-queue-store.js so that the store
 * stays a pure, side-effect-free storage module that a unit test can drive
 * without a DOM, a ScriptLoader, or a Firebase.
 *
 * SECOND JOB: be the witness that outlives the browser.
 *
 * The store's detectLoss() spots an eviction by finding its localStorage
 * counter alive next to an empty object store. That works for a partial
 * eviction and cannot work for the one the file's own comments kept naming:
 * WebKit's 7-day ITP purge (and "Clear History and Website Data") deletes
 * every script-writable store this origin owns in ONE operation, so the
 * counter dies with the photos and detectLoss() has nothing to compare —
 * it returned 0 and the rep was told nothing at all. Nothing kept on the
 * device can survive that; the only witness that can is the server.
 *
 * So while there are photos held, this module mirrors the pending count to
 * userSettings/{uid} (already owner-read/write in firestore.rules), and when
 * it boots to find the local counter GONE it asks the server whether photos
 * were owed. The marker is written only by a device that has its own local
 * counter — a second device must never clear the record of photos still
 * sitting on the first one.
 *
 * THIRD JOB: keep the local counter alive, because we delete it ourselves.
 *
 * nbd-auth.js purgeAccountStorage() drops every `nbd_`-prefixed localStorage
 * key outside its KEEP set on EVERY logout and account switch, while the
 * IndexedDB rows sit there untouched. Nothing re-created the counter, so an
 * ordinary sign-out left detectLoss() with no baseline and no way back —
 * blind until the next add() or remove() happened to rewrite it. A rep who
 * signed out on Friday and was evicted on Monday was told nothing.
 *
 * The same gap made the server read above a per-BOOT cost rather than a
 * per-device one: a rep who has never queued a photo has no counter to write,
 * so every dashboard load re-opened IndexedDB, waited for auth and re-read the
 * marker. (An earlier version of this comment claimed otherwise. It was
 * wrong.) Seeding the counter on boot — only ever ESTABLISHING it, never
 * overwriting a real one — closes both.
