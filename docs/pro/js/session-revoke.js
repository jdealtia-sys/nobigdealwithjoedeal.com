/**
 * session-revoke.js — the "Sign Out Everywhere" button's real behaviour.
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG (2026-09-08 claims audit)
 * ────────────────────────────────────────
 * Settings → Security shipped a red "Sign Out Everywhere" button wired to
 * data-action="signOut" → window._signOut(), whose entire body is a
 * localStorage sweep plus signOut(auth). That is a purely LOCAL sign-out: it
 * clears THIS browser's persistence and nothing else. An attacker holding a
 * session on another device kept refreshing it indefinitely, and
 * /pro/how-to.html told users to rely on exactly that button after a
 * suspected password compromise.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE ACTION, NOT A FIX TO _signOut
 * ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * data-action="signOut" is on THREE buttons in dashboard.html: the header
 * "Sign Out →" (:378), Danger Zone's plain "Sign Out" (:3138), and the
 * Security panel's "Sign Out Everywhere" (:4113). Teaching _signOut to
 * revoke would silently make every ordinary sign-out nuke the user's phone
 * and tablet too — a much worse bug than the one being fixed. So the
 * everywhere button gets its own dispatch, and _signOut stays local.
 *
 * Registered in __NBD_CALL_REGISTRY, which dashboard-ui.js's _nbdResolveCall
 * consults BEFORE the _NBD_CALL_ALLOWLIST/window fallback — so this needs no
 * allowlist entry and no global. Markup stays CSP-clean (no inline script, no
 * on*= attribute); this file loads with defer.

   * Confirm → revoke server-side → sign out locally.
   *
   * The confirm text says "every device" because that is what this does BY
   * DESIGN: the user's own phone, tablet and office desktop are logged out
   * alongside the attacker's. Someone reaching for this mid-breach should not
   * be surprised by it, and someone who only wanted to leave this browser has
   * the plain Sign Out button one panel away.
   *
   * The "within an hour" line is not hedging — revokeRefreshTokens kills
   * refresh tokens, while an ID token already in another device's memory
   * stays valid until it expires. Promising "instantly" would be the same
   * class of lie this whole change exists to remove.
