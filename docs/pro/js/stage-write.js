/**
 * stage-write.js — the ONE safe way to change a lead's `stage` in Firestore.
 *
 * Foundation piece for the 2026-09-15 CRM stage-progression rework. Before
 * this file existed there were two independent implementations of "write a
 * new stage to Firestore":
 *
 *   - crm-pipeline.js's moveCard() (kanban drag/drop, context menu, list
 *     view) — a Firestore transaction with race guards (STAGE_RACE_NOOP /
 *     STAGE_RACE_LOST), stageRole stamping, an activity-log note, and an
 *     EmailDrip trigger.
 *   - customer-bootstrap.module.js's progressStage() ("Move to Next Stage"
 *     on the customer detail page) — a PLAIN updateDoc with no race
 *     protection at all, duplicating (by hand) the note + drip logic above.
 *
 * A rep on the kanban and a rep/customer-page session racing on the same
 * lead could silently last-write-wins clobber each other's stage change
 * through the second path. This module is the single choke point both
 * callers now go through, so every stage change gets the same transaction
 * safety, the same bookkeeping, and — going forward — the same required-
 * field gate and stage-entry checklist hook, in exactly one place.
 *
 * Pure-ish: reads Firebase helpers off `window.*` (the convention this app
 * already uses everywhere — doc/runTransaction/updateDoc/arrayUnion/
 * serverTimestamp/addDoc/collection are all wired onto `window` by both
 * dashboard-bootstrap.module.js and customer-bootstrap.module.js), so it
 * works unmodified from either page. No DOM, no board/render assumptions —
 * callers own all UI (optimistic render, toasts, reload-vs-in-place).

/**

 * @param {string} newStage          destination stage key
 * @param {string} oldStage          the stage the caller believes the lead
 *                                    is currently on (used for the
 *                                    STAGE_RACE_LOST check and the history
 *                                    entry's `from`)
 * @param {Object} [opts]
 * @param {boolean} [opts.isLostMove]   stamp closedAt/lostReason
 * @param {string}  [opts.lostReason]
 * @param {boolean} [opts.isDrag]       true ONLY for genuine drag-and-drop
 *   call sites where `newStage` is a COLUMN key, not necessarily an exact
 *   stage match — enables the column-collapse NOOP guard. See moveCard's
 *   own isDrag doc-comment in crm-pipeline.js for the full rationale; this
 *   flag exists here only so callers keep that exact behavior, not to
 *   re-explain it.
 * @param {string}  [opts.actorLabel]   'user' field for the history event
 *                                       (defaults to the signed-in user's
 *                                       email)
 * @returns {Promise<{historyEvent: Object}>} resolves once the transaction
 *   (or fallback plain write), the activity note, and the drip trigger have
 *   all been attempted. Activity-note and drip failures are swallowed
 *   (console.warn only) — matching both prior implementations, since
 *   neither should block the stage write itself from succeeding.
 * @throws {Error} with `.message` one of:
 *   - 'STAGE_RACE_NOOP'  — another tab/session already landed on this exact
 *     stage (or, for a drag move, the same visible column). Nothing to do;
 *     the caller should treat the destination as already-correct.
 *   - 'STAGE_RACE_LOST'  — another tab/session moved the lead to a
 *     DIFFERENT stage since the caller's `oldStage` snapshot. The caller
 *     must NOT re-apply its own move; refresh from Firestore instead.
 *   - anything else — a genuine write failure (offline, rules denial, …).
