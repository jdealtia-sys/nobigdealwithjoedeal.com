/**
 * stage-checklist.js — the actual "drives the work" mechanism.
 *
 * 2026-09-15 (driven-UX foundation). Everything else in this pass (the
 * clickable next-action chip, the shared preferredActionFor() helper) is
 * still the rep noticing a suggestion and choosing to act on it. This is
 * the part that removes the noticing: the moment a lead ENTERS a stage,
 * the single most relevant follow-up (the same one preferredActionFor()
 * would show on the kanban chip) shows up as a real task in the lead's
 * task list — on Today's Tasks, the notification bell, everywhere a task
 * already surfaces — without the rep having to look at the board at all.
 *
 * Sibling to EmailDrip.onStageChange: stage-write.js's commitStageChange()
 * calls both, the same way, after every successful stage write (kanban
 * drag, list-view stage select, context-menu move, Close-Job/prev-next
 * arrows, AND customer.html's "Move to Next Stage" — this file is loaded
 * on both pages, exactly like nbd-comms.js/EmailDrip already is).
 *
 * Deliberately ONE task per stage entry, not one per possible action —
 * STAGE_ACTIONS often lists several things a rep COULD do at a stage
 * (send a doc, log a call, advance further); flooding the task list with
 * all of them defeats the point of a next-action surface. The task ID is
 * deterministic (stage key + action id, mirroring the dedupe pattern
 * functions/integrations/measurement.js already uses for exactly this
 * reason) and existence-checked before writing, so re-entering the same
 * stage — a correction, a retry, a race between two tabs — never
 * duplicates or silently reopens a task the rep already completed.
