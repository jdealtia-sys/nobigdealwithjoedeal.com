/**
 * catalog-costs.js — the TENANT's own catalog cost book.
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED AND WHY. product-data.js and roofivent-catalog.js are static
 * files under docs/, which is hosting.public AND a public GitHub repo. They
 * used to carry wholesale `cost` beside retail `sell` for every SKU (GAF
 * Timberline HDZ: sell 240 / cost 82 — a 66% margin anyone could compute),
 * plus overheadMultiplier and profitMarginPct on every labor block. That was
 * two leaks at once:
 *
 *   1. anyone could read one company's buy prices off a URL, and
 *   2. every OTHER tenant was seeded with those same figures as their
 *      "defaults" — one company's supplier terms became the whole platform's
 *      starting pricing.
 *
 * Both are closed by making cost data TENANT-OWNED. The published catalog now
 * carries spec + retail `sell` only (retail is already printed on every
 * homeowner estimate, so publishing it costs nothing). Cost and the whole
 * `labor` block live in Firestore at catalogCosts/{companyId} — readable by
 * that tenant's members, writable by its owner/company_admin, and never
 * distributed to anyone else. There is no platform-wide copy.
 *
 * A TENANT WITH NO COST BOOK HAS NO COSTS. That is the correct state, not a
 * bug: `cost` is absent, and product-library.js renders "Cost not set" rather
 * than inventing a 100% margin. Filling it in is the tenant's job.
 *
 * LOAD ORDER (script-loader.js `estimates` bundle):
 *   product-data → roofivent-catalog → catalog-costs → product-library → …
 *
 * Two paths, because product-library.js seeds localStorage SYNCHRONOUSLY at
 * the bottom of its IIFE and a Firestore read cannot be awaited in front of a
 * <script> tag:
 *
 *   WARM DEVICE — the tenant-keyed cache is applied to window.NBD_PRODUCTS at
 *   load, before product-library runs, so seedDefaults()/migrateStore() see a
 *   complete catalog exactly as they did when costs were inline.
 *
 *   COLD DEVICE — no cache. product-library seeds sell-only, hydrate() reads
 *   Firestore, and _productLib.applyCostSeed() patches the store in place. It
 *   patches ONLY untouched defaults, so a rep who already edited a product
 *   keeps their numbers, and it deliberately does NOT bump updatedAt — doing
 *   so would mark every product user-edited and permanently freeze
 *   migrateStore's ability to land future catalog fixes.
 *
 * UPGRADE PATH FOR EXISTING TENANTS. Before this change every tenant's costs
 * lived only in per-device localStorage (nbd_product_library). If the tenant
 * has no cost book yet but this device's store DOES have costs, adoptLocal()
 * uploads them once — so nobody loses the numbers they have been quoting off,
 * and a second device stops silently disagreeing with the first (the same
 * per-device drift #1139 fixed for county overrides).
 *
 * The cache is per-device localStorage under an `nbd_`-prefixed, tenant-keyed
 * name, so NBDAuth.purgeAccountStorage() drops it on sign-out and on account
 * switch — a shared device never hands the next rep the previous tenant's cost
 * book. Same cleanup the product library itself already relies on.
 *
 * ── JOB TEMPLATE COSTS (2026-08-18) ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The same leak, in a second subsystem. docs/pro/js/job-templates-data.js
 * shipped 84 `custom` line items carrying materialCost + laborCost — 146
 * non-zero contractor figures on a public URL and a public repo, beside a
 * public estimate-logic-engine.js carrying the markup constants. Same fix,
 * same document: this book now also carries a `jtCosts` map, keyed
 * 'jt-<slug(templateId)>-<index>' — the key job-templates.js has already been
 * computing for its EstimateBuilderV2.CATALOG bridge since v1, so the strip
 * was a pure deletion and no new identifier was minted.
 *
 * It rides catalogCosts/{companyId} rather than a new collection ON PURPOSE:
 * firestore.rules already governs every field of that document, so the
 * migration needed ZERO rules changes — and a rules typo is the failure mode
 * that locks a live tenant out of their own money data.
 *
 * Same two paths as products. WARM: the tenant-keyed cache is applied at parse
 * time, fourteen bundle entries before job-templates-data.js, so
 * job-templates.js's load-time registerAllCustomItems() already sees the
 * tenant's numbers. COLD: hydrate() reads Firestore and pushToJobTemplates()
 * calls JobTemplates.applyJtCostSeed(), which re-registers every custom item
 * at the real cost and drops the UI's price-band cache.
 *
 * A TENANT WITH NO COST BOOK HAS NO COSTS applies here too, with one
 * counter-intuitive twist worth stating where people will read it: the
 * unpriced state is an EXPLICIT ZERO plus a `costUnset` flag, never an omitted
 * key. estimate-logic-engine.js:803 resolves `laborId = item.laborId ||
 * inferLaborId(item)` BEFORE it tests `item.laborCost != null`, and
 * inferLaborId falls through to LABOR_BY_SUB[item.category] against the still-
 * public labor catalog. Omitting the key routes 14 of the 84 items to a real
 * labor rate and prices them confidently wrong — "Attic insulation baffles" at
 * $500 instead of $142.50, wearing a "Cost not set" badge. The zero keeps
 * labSource 'explicit'; `costUnset` is what presentation reads.
 *
 * See functions/job-template-cost-logic.js and
 * documentation/audit/JOB-TEMPLATE-COST-LEAK-2026-08-18.md.
