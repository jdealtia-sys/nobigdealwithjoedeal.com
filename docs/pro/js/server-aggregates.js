/**
 * server-aggregates.js — Stage B slice 1: SHADOW server-side counts.
 *
 * Ops Audit #4 P1 item 4 ("client loads every lead") can't be fixed by
 * truncating the fetch: 11 consumers (KPIs, money dashboard, global
 * search, export, forecasting, ROI) compute over window._leads and
 * would silently under-report. The migration path is server-side
 * aggregates — and step one is proving they AGREE with the cache
 * before anything consumes them.
 *
 * This module runs a Firestore count() aggregation over the same
 * predicate loadLeads uses (userId == uid) and compares it against
 * window._leadsRawCount — the PRE-filter page-union total loadLeads
 * stashes — so the comparison is apples-to-apples (window._leads
 * itself is post-filter and would mismatch by design).
 *
 * SHADOW ONLY: nothing in the UI reads these numbers. Behind the
 * `serverAggregatesShadow` feature flag (feature_flags/_default) so it
 * costs zero reads until deliberately enabled. Mismatches log a
 * console.warn (picked up by Sentry breadcrumbs) with both values;
 * agreement logs quietly at info. Once this has run clean in prod for
 * a while, slice 2 starts moving KPI counts onto getCountFromServer
 * and the fetch can eventually page-and-stop.
 *
 * Aggregation queries are priced at 1 doc-read per 1000 index entries
 * scanned — the shadow costs ~1 read per dashboard boot while it runs.
