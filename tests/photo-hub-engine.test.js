/**
 * tests/photo-hub-engine.test.js — the embedded customer Photos hub must not
 * mistake the lazy placeholder for the real PhotoEngine, and must not lose or
 * misfile photos.
 *
 * ROOT CAUSE (findings 10/11, and half of 3/13):
 * dashboard-actions.js installs `window.PhotoEngine = { __nbdLazyPhotosStub: true, … }`
 * as a placeholder meaning "the photos bundle has not loaded yet". The hub's
 * ensureEngine() tested bare truthiness, so it accepted that placeholder as the
 * engine and never called loadBundle('photos'). Everything then failed
 * differently:
 *   - the stub's method shims fire-and-forget and return undefined, so the
 *     upload chain called .then() on undefined and threw BEFORE its .catch was
 *     attached. The whole chain rejected: files 2..N were skipped and the
 *     terminal handler — the only place _busy is cleared and the toasts live —
 *     never ran, so the button sat on "⬆ Uploading…" forever.
 *   - the stub carries no deletePhoto/updatePhotoTags at all, so Delete and the
 *     tag chips fell through to "still loading" permanently: the load that
 *     would have fixed them was exactly what ensureEngine had skipped.
 *
 * Also pinned here:
 *   - the batch must pin its leadId (photos were written under whichever
 *     customer was on screen when each .then RAN, not the one being uploaded for)
 *   - fresh uploads must not sort to the bottom under "Older"
 *   - tag edits must recompute `phase`, which the Before/After buckets read
 *   - the cache seeding must be idempotent (two writers share it)
 *
 * Zero deps.  Run: node tests/photo-hub-engine.test.js
