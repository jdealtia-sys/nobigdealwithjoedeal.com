/**
 * The site must not deny subcontracting.
 *
 * WHY (2026-09-20)
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 124 service pages carried the badge "I don't subcontract", styled identically
 * to "Licensed & insured" two slots to its right — so a homeowner read it as a
 * verified fact of the same class. Jo subcontracts: he runs the company himself
 * with no salespeople, and brings in established trade crews (roofing
 * residential + commercial, gutters, siding, interior/drywall) who are
 * independent subcontractors, not employees.
 *
 * The site also contradicted itself in public. docs/partners.html openly
 * recruits those crews — "Crews & Subcontractors", and a JSON-LD FAQPage entry
 * "How are subcontractor crews paid?" — on an indexed page, in structured data,
 * on the same domain. And docs/blog/how-to-choose-a-roofer-after-a-storm.html
 * coaches homeowners to ask "Who is actually on my roof — your crew or a sub?"
 * A homeowner following NBD's own advice caught NBD.
 *
 * WHAT THIS PINS
 * ──────────────
 * 1. No denial phrasing anywhere in customer-facing docs/.
 * 2. The replacement badge is on all 124 service pages, and the GENERATOR emits
 *    it too — otherwise the next stamped page reintroduces the old sentence.
 * 3. partners.html's honest Crews & Subcontractors track SURVIVES. This is the
 *    guard that matters most on a mechanical fix pass: seven reviewers flagged
 *    that section as a "contradiction" and every one was rejected on
 *    verification, because it is the correct half. The foreseeable accident is
 *    someone "resolving" the contradiction by deleting the only honest public
 *    statement while the denials stay live. If that happens, this fails.
 * 4. llms.txt answers "Who does the work?" with the crews named. That file
 *    exists to be quoted verbatim by AI assistants and is advertised twice in
 *    robots.txt; before this it mentioned crews zero times in 165 lines, so an
 *    assistant asked "does Joe subcontract?" answered "no, solo operator".
 *
 * Pure Node, zero deps. Run: node tests/subcontracting-honesty.test.js
