// @ts-check
// tests/e2e/fixtures/seeded-run.js — delete what ONE spec run seeded, by tag.
//
// 2026-09-25, phone-audit follow-up (documentation/qa/phone-audit-2026-09-25.md
// → Follow-ups §7): phone-chrome seeded a lead, an estimate and two photos in
// each describe and never removed them, and phone-dashnav leaked its lead
// whenever beforeAll timed out, because the id it deleted by was never
// returned. Every later spec in the same emulator shard then saw those
// records (lists sort newest-first, so "the first estimate" became ours).
//
// The fix has two halves:
//   1. A spec stamps every doc it seeds with e2eTestData:true (what the
//      cleanupE2ETestData callable sweeps, on a rig that runs functions) and
//      an e2eRun tag unique to this run of this describe. The tag is set
//      BEFORE the first write, so it is known even if the hook dies.
//   2. Its afterAll calls deleteSeededRun(), which finds the docs BY TAG,
//      never by ids held in test variables — so a hook that timed out after
//      its writes still gets cleaned.
//
// Scope is userId == the signed-in user AND e2eRun == this run. Never wider:
// the shared local rig runs several lanes on the ONE test user at once, and a
// sweep of every e2eTestData doc would delete another lane's seeds mid-run.
// The test user owns every doc it seeded, so the owner-delete rules allow it
// from the client — no Cloud Function needed (the audit shard runs none).
//
// One known remainder: rows the APP files under leads/{id}/documents (the
// customer report the doc viewer saves) cannot be deleted from a client.
// documentStatusWriteOk() in firestore.rules reads request.resource, which
// is null on a delete, so the rule errors and denies (checked on the
// emulator 2026-09-25: 403 for the lead's owner; no client code deletes
// these rows today). They stay orphaned under the deleted lead, where no
// client query reaches them; the cleanupE2ETestData callable removes them on
// a rig that runs functions.
const { loginAs, safeEvaluate } = require('./auth');

// Top-level collections a seeded doc can land in. Leads are handled
// separately: their tasks subcollection goes first, because the task rule
// reads the parent lead and would deny once the lead is gone.

/**
 * Where a seed is written, wrap it so a later cleanup can wait for it:
 * `window.__e2eSeeding = (async () => { ... })()`. The sweep waits (up to
 * 15s) for that promise, then (up to 10s more) for every write the Firestore
 * SDK still holds unacknowledged, before it looks anything up. A beforeAll
 * that timed out mid-seed leaves the seed running. And on a stalled rig
 * (2026-09-25) a seed's read-back found no lead and returned null, the sweep
 * found nothing either, and the tagged lead was in the emulator afterwards:
 * a write still in flight when both looked.
 *
 * Lookups go to the server (getDocsFromServer), never the cache: a stalled
 * emulator would otherwise hand back a partial list, and the sweep would
 * report a clean result. A stalled rig also puts the SDK "offline" for a
 * while — getDocsFromServer then fails at once, and one lookup that waited
 * 10s left its estimate behind (both seen 2026-09-25). So every lookup is
 * retried, one try at most 10s, until a 45s budget runs out. Deletes are
 * queued in issue order (tasks before their lead; the SDK commits in that
 * order) and awaited together within what is left of the budget. A dead rig
 * shows up as `failed` entries, never a hung afterAll.
 *
