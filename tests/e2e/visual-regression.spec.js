/**
 * Visual regression baseline.
 *
 * For each route + viewport pair below, Playwright takes a full-page
 * screenshot and diffs it against a committed baseline at
 * tests/e2e/visual-regression.spec.js-snapshots/{name}.png.
 *
 * First run on a new baseline: `npm --prefix tests run test:e2e:update`
 * (sets PLAYWRIGHT_UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1) writes the baseline images.
 * Subsequent runs compare against the committed baselines and fail
 * the build if any pixel differs beyond the configured threshold.
 *
 * The snapshots cover only PUBLIC pages (login, register, pricing,
 * landing). Authenticated screens require a signed-in session and
 * live in pro-authed.spec.js — visual regression for those is a
 * follow-up after the dev Firebase project lands (Joe-action #19).
 *
 * Why pixel-diff and not a string match
 *   - Catches CSS regressions like the "toolbar still tight" issue
 *     where the deployed CSS is correct but the rendered output
 *     doesn't match what we expected.
 *   - One screenshot covers font load, layout, animations, color,
 *     spacing simultaneously — no need to write 30 string assertions.
 *
 * Tuning
 *   - The pixel-diff threshold is generous (0.2 = 20% per-pixel
 *     tolerance) to absorb font subpixel rendering jitter across
 *     CI environments. Tighten when we have a dev Firebase project
 *     pinning Chromium versions.
 *   - We mask high-entropy regions (timestamps, dynamic counters)
 *     with the `mask` option to avoid false-positive flakes.

// Same-origin /api/* responses these pages render, pinned to fixed payloads.

// WHY (2026-09-13): CI serves docs/ from the hosting emulator, but
// `emulators:exec --only hosting` leaves firebase.json's function rewrites
// pointing at PRODUCTION. When the Places secrets went live (~22:31Z), prod
// /api/google-reviews began returning real reviews, the landing page rendered
// five live review cards instead of the "Read our reviews on Google" fallback,
// and the page grew 1337px at mobile-375. Every commit's visual job went red
// with no code change (d7506665, docs-only). A baseline blessed against live
// Google data would break again with the next review.
//
// `{ reviews: [], total: 0 }` renders google-reviews-widget.js's fallback card
// (renderAll → renderFallback) and hydrates no rating hooks. That is the state
// the committed baselines were captured in, so no re-bless is needed. What the

// Google's.
