/**
 * Xactimate must be readable by a HUMAN, not just by a crawler.
 *
 * THE DEFECT (2026-09-20)
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * "Xactimate" appeared on docs/index.html exactly once — at line 555, inside
 * the `knowsAbout` array of a JSON-LD block — and ZERO times on
 * docs/services/storm-damage.html, which is the page the homepage's storm card
 * links to and the page whose <title> is "Storm Damage & Insurance Claims".
 *
 * Estimating in the same software the insurer prices the claim in is the single
 * competency that separates this from a roofer who "helps with the claim", and
 * it was legible only to machines. docs/about.html:690 already had it written
 * in Jo's own voice; both surfaces now reuse that wording rather than inventing
 * a new claim.
 *
 * WHAT THIS PINS
 * The word must appear OUTSIDE <script> tags. A regex over raw HTML cannot tell
 * the difference — the original, defective page would have passed one — so this
 * suite strips every <script> block first and searches what is left. That is
 * the whole point of the file.
 *
 * Pure Node, zero deps. Run: node tests/xactimate-human-readable.test.js
