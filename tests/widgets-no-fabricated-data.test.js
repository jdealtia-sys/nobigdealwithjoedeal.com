/**
 * tests/widgets-no-fabricated-data.test.js — dashboard widgets must not invent
 * data.
 *
 * Two widgets rendered hardcoded numbers as if they were the tenant's:
 *
 *   team-leaderboard  "Joe Deal $48.5k / 12 deals", "Mike S. $32.1k",
 *                     "Sarah K. $27.8k" — comment: "Pull from leaderboard data
 *                     or simulate".
 *   material-watch    "OC Duration $98/sq +2%", "GAF Timberline $102/sq -1%",
 *                     "Synthetic Felt $67/roll", "Drip Edge 10ft $4.50/pc" —
 *                     comment: "Simulated price data — in production would
 *                     fetch from supplier API". There is no supplier API.
 *
 * Both are opt-in from an UNGATED picker, and a brand-new tenant staring at an
 * empty dashboard is precisely who browses the widget gallery for something to
 * fill it. He adds a leaderboard and finds a stranger named Joe Deal topping
 * HIS board.
 *
 * material-watch was the dangerous one: specific, authoritative-looking, and
 * directly ACTIONABLE. A roofer pricing a job off "$98/sq" for a shingle he
 * hasn't quoted loses real money on a real roof. It was removed rather than
 * given an empty state — a price watch that never has data is a permanently
 * broken tile. No widget beats a lying one.
 *
 * Zero deps.  Run: node tests/widgets-no-fabricated-data.test.js
