/* nav-contract.test.js
 *
 * The header, the mobile drawer and the Services dropdown, pinned.
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG (2026-09-08 nav reliability audit)
 * --------------------------------------------------
 * Every nav rule was hand-inlined into each page's <style> block. 233 copies
 * drifted into 6 different `.mobile-nav` variants; 46 files carried 2-4
 * competing definitions of it in the same file. Measured on WebKit at 320x508
 * (iPod touch), the shipped drawer was broken four ways at once:
 *
 *   - `top:70px` / `top:108px` were constants, but the header's real bottom
 *     edge moves between 70px and 129px as the announcement bar scrolls out
 *     from above a position:sticky nav. Every page was wrong at one scroll
 *     position or the other: 40-59px of the drawer hidden behind the header,
 *     or a 38px gap leaking page content through.
 *   - Nothing locked body scroll, so the page scrolled freely underneath the
 *     pinned drawer. Reported as "the slider moves but the page doesn't".
 *   - `.mobile-cta-strip` is fixed at z-index 999 — the drawer's z-index, and
 *     later in the DOM — so the Call/Text bar painted over the drawer's
 *     bottom, which is where Book Inspection lives.
 *   - Net effect: 6 of 32 links reachable without scrolling a position:fixed
 *     overflow container, the least reliable thing to ask of old iOS Safari.
 *
 * WHY THESE ASSERTIONS AND NOT OTHERS
 * -----------------------------------
 * Coverage is the assertion that would actually have caught the bug: 10 pages
 * (including the homepage) live outside the nbd:partial markers, so stamping
 * the partials reached 222 files and silently missed those. A gate that only
 * checked the partials would have been green while / was still broken.
 *
 * The z-index check compares PARSED NUMBERS from two real files rather than
 * grepping for a literal, so bumping .mobile-cta-strip to 1200 tomorrow fails
 * here instead of silently re-covering the drawer.
 *
 * Geometry itself is not assertable without a browser — that half lives in
 * tests/e2e/marketing.spec.js, which opens the drawer at 320x508 and measures
 * it. This file is the cheap always-runs half.
