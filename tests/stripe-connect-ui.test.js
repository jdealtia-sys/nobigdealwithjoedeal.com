/**
 * tests/stripe-connect-ui.test.js — Connect phase 2: the Settings → Billing
 * payouts card.
 *
 * Phase 1 (#1143) shipped five callables with NO caller. This is the caller, so
 * these are the first assertions that anything user-facing touches Connect.
 *
 * Four things are load-bearing here, and each has burned this repo before:
 *
 *  1. CAPABILITY TRUTH. REWRITTEN 2026-07-3x: phase 3 lifted the #1123 gate, so
 *     the honesty problem inverted. Finishing onboarding now grants a real
 *     capability, which means the card must (a) be reachable by the people the
 *     server lets act — owner OR company_admin, mirroring requireTeamAdmin —
 *     and (b) say which state the account is actually in: "Online card payments
 *     are ON" when Stripe says so, "not switched on" when it doesn't, and the
 *     price (3.4% + 30…) in BOTH, because a fee the contractor first learns
 *     about from a payout is a fee we hid. Part 8 couples the card to the
 *     server gate in both directions so neither can move alone: a widened card
 *     over a closed gate is asking for an SSN for nothing; a lifted gate behind
 *     an owner-only card charges tenants for something they cannot see.
 *
 *  2. TEMPLATE RE-EXECUTION. The module ships inside the lazily-hydrated
 *     tpl-view-settings template and runs AGAIN at hydration, after DCL. A bare
 *     top-level `const` throws on the second run; a bare DCL listener never
 *     installs; an unguarded delegate double-fires — and a double-fired
 *     "create my Stripe account" is the exact race phase 1's idempotency key
 *     exists to survive.
 *
 *  3. THE BLANK-SETTINGS HAZARD. switchSettingsTab() hides EVERY .stab-panel and
 *     shows one only `if (panel)`, so a URL-supplied tab name that doesn't exist
 *     leaves the user on an empty Settings screen. The deep link must allowlist.
 *
 *  4. APP CHECK. All five callables set enforceAppCheck:true, so they must be
 *     invoked via the callable SDK (which attaches the token) from a page that
 *     initialises App Check. A raw fetch() 401s — silently, in a catch.
 *
 * Zero deps.  Run: node tests/stripe-connect-ui.test.js
