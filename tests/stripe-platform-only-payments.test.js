/**
 * tests/stripe-platform-only-payments.test.js — where a homeowner's money is
 * allowed to land, and what must be true before it moves.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. Stripe serves two different money flows here through ONE client
 * on the platform's secret key:
 *   1. subscription billing — a contractor paying US. Ours. Correct.
 *   2. invoice payment links — a contractor's HOMEOWNER paying the CONTRACTOR.
 *      Theirs. Was settling into OUR balance.
 *
 * getStripe() memoizes one client on STRIPE_SECRET_KEY. That was fine while we
 * were the only tenant and became wrong the moment anyone else could sign up —
 * chargebacks against our account for work we did not do, a 1099-K reporting
 * their revenue as ours, and collecting funds on behalf of other businesses
 * (which is why Connect exists).
 *
 * STATUS 2026-07-3x: Connect Express PHASE 3 is LIVE — destination charges
 * route tenant mints to connected accounts, gated by mayCollectOnline(); the
 * platform tenant's own mints are unchanged (no routing, no platform fee). The
 * blanket "no tenant may ever collect online" premise this file was born with
 * is therefore RETIRED, exactly as the phase-1 rewrite note below predicted.
 * What replaces it is CONFINEMENT plus a GATE — that is what the parts pin now.
 *
 * So this pins:
 *   Part 1 — the MONEY primitives are CONFINED, not absent: they may appear in
 *            functions/stripe.js and nowhere else under functions/ — never
 *            inside the four subscription-billing exports, and never in the two
 *            Connect files (which stay accounts-only). Connect ACCOUNT plumbing
 *            stays confined to those same two Connect files.
 *   Part 2 — the three-way gate in createStripePaymentLink: platform tenant →
 *            mint as before; a capable tenant with a live subscription →
 *            destination mint with the platform fee; everyone else → 403
 *            ONLINE_PAYMENTS_UNAVAILABLE, returned BEFORE any Stripe call.
 *   Part 3 — the client capability mirror fails closed, caches only definitive
 *            answers, and an invoice is never lost because a link failed.
 *   Part 4 — the OTHER homeowner→contractor path (esign C5 auto-invoices) is
 *            STILL platform-only; phase 3 deliberately did not port it.
 *
 * Zero deps.  Run: node tests/stripe-platform-only-payments.test.js

// ── Part 1: the money primitives are CONFINED, not absent ─────────────
//
// REWRITTEN 2026-07-29 (Connect phase 1), exactly as the original assertion
// instructed: it asserted "no Connect plumbing anywhere in functions/", which
// was the gate's premise while Connect did not exist. Phase 1 added connected
// ACCOUNTS + onboarding, so that assertion fired — the documented signal to
// rewrite it deliberately, never to delete it.
//
// The premise the gate actually rests on is narrower and still true: no code
// path can route a homeowner's payment to a tenant's account. So this now pins
// two things instead:
//   (a) the MONEY primitives are absent everywhere — that is what makes the
//       platform-only gate still necessary. When phase 3 lifts the gate, THIS
//       is the assertion to rewrite (again, deliberately), and the gate checks
//       in Parts 2-4 are what must be replaced by mayCollectOnline().
//   (b) the ACCOUNT primitives are confined to the two Connect files, so
//       account plumbing cannot quietly appear inside the subscription or
//       invoice paths.
//
// REWRITTEN AGAIN 2026-07-3x (Connect phase 3), on the instruction the previous
// rewrite left behind: phase 3 mints DESTINATION charges, so (a) fired — the
// money primitives now exist, deliberately. The premise that replaces
// "absent everywhere" is CONFINEMENT, which is the property that actually
// protects the two flows from each other:
//   (a') the money primitives live in functions/stripe.js and NOWHERE else
//        under functions/. The allowlist is deliberately ONE file — not the two
//        Connect files, which stay accounts-only so that reading either of them
//        can never leave you wondering whether it moves money (their own
//        containment loop, tests/stripe-connect.test.js:197-201, says the same
//        thing from the other side).
//   (a'') within stripe.js, the four SUBSCRIPTION-billing exports must stay
//        money-primitive-free and connected-account-free: contractors paying us
//        is a different flow from homeowners paying contractors, and the whole
//        point of the confinement is that neither leaks into the other.
//        (functions/handlers/seats.js needs no slice — it is covered by the
//        directory walk above, which allows it zero money primitives at all.)
//   (b) is UNCHANGED and still true: stripe.js gains no ACCOUNT primitive —
//        the mint only reads connectState.accountId strings out of Firestore.
//        (Note `transfers.createReversal` matches MONEY, not ACCOUNT.)
// Phase 4 rewrites these premises again — deliberately. Never deletes them.

// ── Part 4: the OTHER homeowner→contractor path is gated too ──────────
// UNCHANGED BY PHASE 3, deliberately: phase 3 lifted the payment-link gate but
// did NOT port C5 — tenant esign auto-invoices stay platform-only, because a
// paid hosted invoice carries no invoiceId metadata and would never credit the
// CRM ledger (see docs/deploy/10-stripe-connect.md and the note in esign.js).
// So every assertion below still asserts what it always did.
// Found while scoping Connect (2026-07-29): createStripePaymentLink was gated
// by #1123, but functions/integrations/esign.js createStripeInvoiceForEstimate
// — which runs from the BoldSign signature webhook on every signed estimate —
// had NO tenant check at all. It creates a Stripe CUSTOMER for the homeowner and
// an INVOICE on the PLATFORM account. Nothing is charged (the invoice is a draft:
// auto_advance:false + collection_method:'send_invoice'), but for a non-platform
// tenant it still parks their homeowner's PII and their job amount in our
// dashboard, one "send" click from collecting another business's money.
