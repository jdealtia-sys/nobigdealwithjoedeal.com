/**
 * photo-offline-queue.test.js — "Photo queued (offline)" used to be a lie.
 *
 * photo-engine.js pushed every failed upload into state.uploadQueue and
 * toasted "Photo queued (offline) — will upload when connected". That push
 * was the ONLY reference to state.uploadQueue in the entire repo: never
 * drained, never retried, never persisted. Every one of those photos was
 * discarded when the tab went away, and the rep was told the opposite — on a
 * roof, in bad signal, which is precisely when it mattered.
 *
 * Two things are locked here:
 *   1. the queue is actually drained (on `online`, and after the next
 *      successful upload — better evidence than an event that may never fire
 *      on a flaky connection that never fully dropped), and failures are
 *      left queued rather than dropped;
 *   2. the message matches what the code can actually back.
 *
 * ── 2026-09-06: the promise got STRONGER, and that is the point ─────────
 * This suite used to assert the toast did NOT say "will upload when
 * connected", because the queue was memory-only and dashboard-sw-bootstrap
 * reloads the page on every bfcache resume — exactly when a rep backgrounds
 * the app — so the photo did not survive leaving the page. The honest copy
 * was "Keep this page open."
 *
 * The queue is now persisted in IndexedDB (docs/pro/js/photo-queue-store.js,
 * proven to survive a reload by tests/photo-queue-durability.test.js) and
 * drained on boot by photo-queue-recovery.js. So the strong promise is now
 * TRUE and the copy says so. The assertion below is not deleted — it is
 * inverted and tied to the persistence that earns it: the durable wording is
 * only allowed to appear alongside a real call into the durable store, so
 * this can never drift back into a claim the code does not implement.
 *
 * The weak "Keep this page open" copy still has to exist, because it is what
 * a rep gets when IndexedDB is genuinely unavailable (private mode, disabled
 * storage). Both branches are asserted.
 *
 * The dataURL→Blob converter is extracted and exercised for real, because a
 * silent failure there would drop the photo just as effectively as the
 * original bug.
 *
 * Run: node tests/photo-offline-queue.test.js   (no deps, no DOM)
