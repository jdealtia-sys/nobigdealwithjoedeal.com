/**
 * tests/dead-controls-tail.test.js — controls that closed, did nothing, and
 * said nothing.
 *
 * Six defects from the silent-failure sweep, sharing one theme: a control whose
 * dependency lives on a DIFFERENT page or inside a lazy bundle nobody asked
 * for. In every case the guard that was supposed to make this safe
 * (`typeof x === 'function'`, `if (!engine) bail`) converted a crash into
 * silence, which is strictly harder to notice.
 *
 *  15/16 command-palette — window.openCardDetail has never existed repo-wide
 *        (the real global is openCardDetailModal), and window.goTo /
 *        openNewLeadModal / _signOut are dashboard globals while the palette
 *        also loads on customer.html. Cmd+K → type a name → Enter did nothing.
 *  17    customer-dnd-upload — photo-engine.js has no static <script> tag
 *        anywhere; it ships only in the lazy 'photos' bundle, which nothing on
 *        customer.html (this module's only surface) requests. Every dropped
 *        image failed with "refresh and try again", and refreshing never helped.
 *  18    supplement-ui — window.NBD_XACT_CATALOG ships only in the lazy
 *        'estimates' bundle, likewise never requested on customer.html, so the
 *        catalog search returned "Catalog not loaded." forever.
 *  19    maps-routing — "📂 Load from Customer" called redrawAll(), which exists
 *        nowhere, and clearAll(), likewise. The drawing loaded into memory and
 *        nothing was painted; the previous drawing's layers stayed on the map.
 *  20    nbd-comms — the stage-email toast built HTML for a renderer that uses
 *        textContent, so the rep saw the raw <button> markup as text.
 *
 * Zero deps.  Run: node tests/dead-controls-tail.test.js
