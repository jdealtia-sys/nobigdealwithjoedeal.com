/* tests/tier-pricing-premium-claim-2026-09-16.test.js
 *
 * The public marketing site claimed Preferred is "+15% over Standard" and
 * Elite is "+30% over Standard" (docs/services/the-nbd-guarantee/index.html
 * ×6, docs/services/the-nbd-build/index.html ×1) — live since 2026-04-21,
 * flagged the same day by documentation/audit/GBB-TIER-SOURCE-OF-TRUTH-
 * 2026-09-09.md, and left deliberately open by that session ("PR 4 ...
 * deliberately still open"). Jo had already asked, days earlier, that
 * "when we give warranties, receipts, they need to match their estimates
 * / docs / etc... make sure it all ties properly."
 *
 * The real numbers, computed from the actual pricing engine
 * (docs/pro/js/estimate-config.js TIER_RATES, good/better/best =
 * 545/595/660 $/SQ, unchanged since the 2026-04-10 locked spec):
 *   better/good - 1 = 595/545 - 1 = 9.174% -> "roughly 9%"
 *   best/good   - 1 = 660/545 - 1 = 21.101% -> "roughly 21%"
 *
 * This suite does NOT hardcode "9%"/"21%" as the thing to protect —  it
 * computes the expected percentage from TIER_RATES directly and asserts
 * the marketing copy matches THAT, rounded the same way a human writing
 * "roughly N%" copy would round it. If TIER_RATES ever changes, this
 * suite reddens and forces a deliberate copy update instead of silently
 * drifting the way the original 15%/30% claim did for five months.
