/**
 * tests/claim-wording.test.js — the public site never markets Joe as the
 * homeowner's insurance-claim representative.
 *
 * WHY (owner decision, 2026-09-27: "reword everywhere")
 *
 * Kentucky KRS 367.628 (version effective July 15, 2026) says a residential
 * contractor shall not:
 *   (1)(a)1. "Represent, negotiate, or advertise to represent or negotiate,
 *            as a public adjuster or otherwise, on behalf of any insured on
 *            any insurance claim"; nor
 *   (1)(a)2. represent or market itself as "a claims specialist or expert",
 *            "an insurance specialist or expert", or as having any
 *            affiliation with an insurer.
 * It explicitly ALLOWS (1)(c)1 providing an estimate and (1)(c)2 conferring
 * with the insurer's representative about damage after the insured has
 * submitted a claim. Ohio reserves negotiating claims for compensation to
 * licensed public adjusters (ORC ch. 3951). The site markets to Kentucky
 * towns from one set of pages, so the whole public tree uses ONE compliant
 * vocabulary: Joe inspects and documents the damage, writes the line-item
 * estimate, meets the adjuster on the roof after the homeowner files, and
 * submits supplements (his own updated estimate for missed line items). The
 * homeowner owns and decides the claim.
 *
 * Before this gate the banner on 224 pages read "I Handle the Insurance
 * Claim for You", and ~150 more sentences said Joe handles / manages /
 * navigates / negotiates / advocates on / fights the claim, or called him an
 * insurance restoration specialist and "insurance claim experts".
 *
 * WHAT IT SCANS: every text file under docs/ except the CRM and private
 * trees (pro/, admin/, sites/, dev/) and vendored libraries. HTML is reduced
 * to text (tags stripped, the common entities decoded) and split into
 * sentences, so JSON-LD answers, meta descriptions and JS strings are all
 * checked. Each rule is proven red against a fixture below — a rule that
 * cannot fail is not a gate.
 *
 * NOT policed here (report-only in the PR that added this): KRS 367.628(2)
 * money terms on insurance-paid jobs — deductible rebates, discounts or
 * allowances, >$100 gifts/referral payments — those need a human read.
 *
 * Run: node tests/claim-wording.test.js
