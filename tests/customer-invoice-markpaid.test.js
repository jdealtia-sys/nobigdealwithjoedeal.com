/**
 * customer-invoice-markpaid.test.js — can a rep record a check?
 *
 * Until 2026-09-06 the answer was no, anywhere in the app, once the modal
 * shown immediately after invoice creation was dismissed:
 *   - the customer page's invoice list was READ-ONLY (its "Pay" link is the
 *     HOMEOWNER'S Stripe link, not a rep action);
 *   - InvoicePipeline.markPaid / markPaidUI ship only on the dashboard; and
 *   - renderInvoicePanel and renderInvoiceList — which both carry the right
 *     View / Send / Mark Paid buttons — are mounted NOWHERE. A grep across
 *     docs/pro finds no caller for either.
 * So "customer paid by check" dead-ended and the invoice stayed open forever.
 *
 * This is a WIRING test, deliberately. The behaviour needs Firestore and a
 * signed-in rep, but every link in the chain is a cross-file assumption that
 * breaks silently, and one of them was already wrong when this was written:
 * invoice-pipeline.js is dashboard code whose getDb() reads window._db, while
 * customer.html sets only window.db — so the first tap would have thrown
 * "Firestore (v9) not initialized" with no visible cause.
 *
 * Run: node tests/customer-invoice-markpaid.test.js   (no deps, no DOM)
