/**
 * tests/estimate-hub-controls.test.js — the per-customer Estimates hub must not
 * hide a destructive action behind a benign label, and must not report success
 * for an action whose result the rep will never see.
 *
 * 1. "🗄 Archive" dispatched deleteEstimateAction -> window._deleteEstimate ->
 *    deleteDoc(). An archive box is the universal "filed away, still there"
 *    affordance; this permanently destroyed the document. The confirm did say
 *    "This cannot be undone", so the control contradicted itself — and the
 *    reassuring half is the part a rep reads first. The dashboard's own
 *    estimates list already calls this exact action "delete"; the hub was the
 *    outlier.
 *
 *    Relabelled rather than converted to a soft delete on purpose: the tenant
 *    estimates snapshots that populate window._estimates apply no `deleted`
 *    filter, so a soft-deleted estimate would stay visible on the dashboard and
 *    Archive would merely look broken instead. A real archive means updating
 *    those readers first — a feature, not a bug fix. This test pins the reason,
 *    so if someone adds the filter later they can see the constraint has lifted.
 *
 * 2. "⎘ Copy" routed to duplicateEstimateAction, whose underlying
 *    _duplicateEstimate deliberately sets `leadId = null` so the copy can be
 *    assigned from the dashboard list — the right default THERE. In a hub that
 *    lists by leadId, the copy was filtered straight out: the rep got
 *    "✓ Estimate duplicated", an unchanged list and an unchanged count.
 *
 * 3. "👤 Assign" (estimate-crm-ops.js's showAssignLeadPicker, opened from the
 *    hub via customer-estimate-hub.js:539) called
 *    window.__NBD_CALL_REGISTRY._assignEstimateToLead with no existence guard.
 *    That function is registered only by dashboard-bootstrap.module.js, which
 *    customer.html never loads (it loads customer-bootstrap.module.js instead)
 *    — so on the customer page the picker opened, the modal closed on
 *    Unassign/a lead click, and the call threw inside an unguarded async
 *    handler: an unhandled rejection, no toast, no assignment. Fixed with the
 *    same typeof-guard-then-toast pattern _deleteEstimate/_renameEstimate
 *    already use in this file, rather than duplicating the ~90-line
 *    money/pipeline stamp-back logic onto a second page (see
 *    docs/dev/globals-tranche3-plan.md's 2026-09-18 estimate-CRUD-edge note —
 *    Duplicate/Delete/Rename are ALSO dashboard-bootstrap-only and were
 *    already degrading to a toast instead of working; Assign now matches).
 *
 * Zero deps.  Run: node tests/estimate-hub-controls.test.js
