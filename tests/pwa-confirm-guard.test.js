/**
 * tests/pwa-confirm-guard.test.js
 *
 * Keeps the iOS-PWA confirm() migration from silently backsliding.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS GUARDS
 * ───────────────────
 * docs/pro/js/standalone-compat.js runs ONLY when the site is open from the
 * home screen (`if (!isStandalone) return;`) and replaces window.confirm with:
 *
 *     window.confirm = function(msg) { ...toast...; return true; };
 *
 * So in the installed PWA — the owner's actual platform — every native
 * confirm() answers YES. "Delete this expense?", "Reset all products to
 * defaults?", "Reset every Company Profile field?" all just happened, and
 * generating a photo report silently EMAILED it to the homeowner because that
 * confirm was an OK=email / Cancel=download choice.
 *
 * The fix is per-call-site: route through window.nbdConfirm (a real
 * Promise<boolean> modal that only exists in standalone mode) with a native
 * fallback for desktop:
 *
 *     const ask = window.nbdConfirm || ((m) => Promise.resolve(window.confirm(m)));
 *     if (!(await ask('…'))) return;
 *
 * A previous batch converted ~20 files and stopped; 2026-09-03 finished the
 * sweep. This test exists so the next raw confirm() someone adds is caught at
 * review time rather than discovered by a contractor losing a day of work.
 *
 * Pure-Node, no emulator. Run: node tests/pwa-confirm-guard.test.js
