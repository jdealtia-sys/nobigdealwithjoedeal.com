/* portal-completion-truth.test.js
 *
 * Two things the portal told a homeowner that were not true.
 *
 * ── 1. "You can rate once the job is complete", on a complete job ──
 *
 * The rating card's RENDER gate was `progressKey === 'complete'`, computed
 * from STAGE_TO_PROGRESS with a fallback to the lead's semantic stage role.
 * Its SUBMIT gate was a hardcoded literal list —
 * ['final_photos','deductible_collected','final_payment','closed'] — under a
 * comment claiming those were "exactly the stages that map to the 'complete'
 * progress milestone". They were not, in two ways, and both reach a real
 * customer:
 *
 *   - A legacy raw display stage ('Complete', 'Closed Won', 'Won', 'Closed')
 *     is not a key in STAGE_TO_PROGRESS, so the view fell through to the role
 *     fallback, stage-roles ALIASed it to 'closed', the role came back 'won',
 *     progressKey became 'complete', and the card rendered. The submit gate
 *     then compared the RAW stage against its list, missed, and answered 409.
 *   - A tenant CUSTOM stage carrying stageRole 'won' does the same.
 *
 * So the homeowner tapped five stars on a finished roof and was told it wasn't
 * finished. Both gates now resolve through one `progressKeyFor(lead)`.
 *
 * ── 2. The homeowner's own photo, as a broken tile ──
 *
 * uploadHomeownerPhoto bakes a 7-day signed URL into the photo doc. Its own
 * comment predicted the consequence and deferred it. After 7 days the URL
 * 403s, and the first person to see it die is the homeowner looking at the
 * gallery they uploaded to. The same doc feeds the rep's customer-page
 * gallery, so it breaks on both sides at once.
 *
 * Both halves run the REAL lifted functions rather than matching source text.
