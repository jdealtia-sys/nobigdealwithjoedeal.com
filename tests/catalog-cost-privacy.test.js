/**
 * tests/catalog-cost-privacy.test.js
 *
 * THE GUARD. docs/ is firebase.json hosting.public, so every file under it is
 * served unauthenticated at the site root — and this is a PUBLIC repo, so the
 * same bytes are readable from raw.githubusercontent.com whether hosting
 * serves them or not. docs/pro/js/product-data.js shipped wholesale COST beside
 * retail SELL for 187 SKUs (readable margin on every product; the real
 * figures are deliberately NOT repeated here — this file is public too), plus overheadMultiplier x176 and profitMarginPct x173, and
 * roofivent-catalog.js shipped a supplier's confidential contractor price list.
 * Worse, those were ONE company's supplier terms, handed to every other tenant
 * as their seed defaults. Cost data is now tenant-owned — it lives in
 * catalogCosts/{companyId} and is never distributed. This file is what stops
 * it coming back into the published tree.
 *
 * Three layers, because "don't publish costs" fails in more than one shape:
 *
 *   1. STRUCTURAL — load the real catalogs and assert no product object carries
 *      a private field. Catches any reintroduction that actually parses.
 *   2. SIGNATURE (every published file) — the retail-beside-wholesale pattern,
 *      `sell: N` and `cost: N` in the same object literal. Deliberately narrow
 *      so it can run over the whole hosting tree without false positives.
 *
 *   …plus layer 4 below, the COST-BASIS SWEEP, which now knows FOUR spellings
 *   of the same shape: cost/labor → mat/lab → materialCost/laborCost →
 *   rate/hoursPerUnit. Each was found only after it had already shipped. Every
 *   one of them is a number PAIRED with its partner, which is what lets these
 *   patterns run over 600 files without noise — and the reason to reach for a
 *   pairing rather than a keyword the next time this list grows.
 *   3. STRICT (EVERY published file, exemptions explicit) — any numeric cost /
 *      contractor / materialCost / laborCost / overheadMultiplier /
 *      profitMarginPct literal at all. Catches a cost table that never reaches
 *      a product object, and the two margin-policy constants that used to sit
 *      in product-library.js as `|| 1.35` / `|| 25`.
 *      This layer ran over a four-entry ALLOWLIST until 2026-08-18, which is
 *      exactly how job-templates-data.js published 84 contractor cost pairs for
 *      a month while this suite reported 48/48 green: it was on neither the
 *      allowlist nor the exception list, and a hole in an inclusion list is
 *      indistinguishable from a pass. It now scans by default; see
 *      STRICT_EXEMPT, where every non-scan is named, reasoned, narrowed to a
 *      line shape where possible, and asserted non-vacuous.
 *
 * Every layer is MUTATION-TESTED below: the scanner is fed a source that
 * reintroduces the leak and must flag it, and fed legitimate non-catalog code
 * and must not. A guard nobody has watched fail is not a guard.
 *
 * Pure-Node, no emulator. Run: node tests/catalog-cost-privacy.test.js

// materialCost + laborCost, 146 non-zero contractor values, served 200 at
// ~188 KB — sat unscanned for a month while this suite reported 48/48 green.
// It was on neither the allowlist nor the exception list, and a hole in an
// inclusion list is indistinguishable from a pass.
//
// That was the SECOND guard defeated by its own list in a single day (the
// morning's svg.ico bug got through because ensure-icon-css.js skipped
// sites/pro/a stale free-guide entry). The durable answer is not "add one more
// file": it is to scan every published file and make every non-scan an
// explicit, reasoned, self-expiring entry below.
//
// Each exemption carries `why` and, where the benign shape is nameable, an
// `allow` regex — a finding on a line that does NOT match `allow` still fails.
// Every exemption is also asserted NON-VACUOUS: if a file stops matching
// entirely, the guard fails and tells you to delete the entry, so this list
// can never rot into a permanent carve-out the way the allowlist did.

// PUBLISHED STARTER BASELINES — what replaced KNOWN_UNMIGRATED (2026-08-19).

//
//   (a) does this file publish a contractor cost basis? OBSERVABLE, and for
//       these files PERMANENT — the baseline IS the product. Strip it and the
//       estimator does not degrade, it turns OFF (measured: a full reroof drops
//       from $12,425 to the $2,500 minimum-job floor with every line at 0,
//       because these values are the pricing and there is no public retail half).
//
//   (b) is that published basis still the shop's ACTUAL cost? NOT OBSERVABLE.
//       It stops being true at ROTATION, which writes catalogCosts/{companyId}
//       in Firestore and does not move one byte of this repo.
//
// The non-vacuity assertion below only ever checked (a) — "the sweep still
// finds pairs here" — while its LABEL claimed (b): "still leaking, keep
// tracking it". The day rotation lands the file is byte-identical, the sweep
// still finds 276 pairs, the assertion still passes, and the guard goes on
// printing a sentence that has become false with nothing anywhere prompting a
// revisit. That is a tracked debt rotting into a permanent carve-out by a route
// non-vacuity structurally cannot see: the file still matches, and the REASON
// changed.
//
// So (a) is asserted here and (b) is SIGNED, per catalog, in
// tests/cost-basis-ledger.js — a dated, named, per-tenant record a human pastes
// from what scripts/import-cost-rotation.js prints after a successful write.
// `rotation: null` is the honest default and is what a green run PRINTS. See
// section 2c below, and the ledger's header for why the pin is a commit rather

/* ── 2c. THE ROTATION LEDGER — what is published, and who signed for it ─── */
//
// This section replaces the KNOWN_UNMIGRATED non-vacuity loop, the hardcoded
// three-row override-path table that used to be 2a0, and two thirds of the
// hand-written labor-catalog block. One table, derived from
// functions/cost-basis-registry.js (files, fields and entry loaders) and
// tests/cost-basis-ledger.js (the human half). A fourth catalog is a registry
// entry plus a ledger row, not another filename pasted into this file.
//
// TWO PROPOSITIONS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS ASSERTABLE.
//
//   OBSERVABLE — the baseline is still published, whatever the registry says
//   must LEAVE has left, the tenant override path is still wired, and layer 4's
//   shape sweep still sees exactly the files it is declared to see. All
//   asserted below, per row, off a STRUCTURAL entry count (REG.pricedEntries)
//   rather than a regex hit count — which is the direct fix for the bug that
//   knocked the labor catalog off the old list: removing hoursPerUnit blinded
//   COST_BASIS_LABOR_RE on 66 still-published rates, and a shape-based list
//   cannot express "this half is closed and that half is deliberately open".
//
//   NOT OBSERVABLE — whether the shop's figures have been ROTATED. That happens
//   in catalogCosts/{companyId}, in Firestore. There is nothing in this repo to
//   read, and any mechanism claiming to detect it automatically is lying about
//   what it can do. So it is a signed human record, and while it is null the
//   guard says the true thing on every green run: these published figures ARE
//   the shop's cost basis today.
//
// WHY THERE IS NO REVIEW CLOCK HERE, since it is the obvious instrument and was
// deliberately rejected. A deadline that only Jo can legitimately clear turns
// this suite — the one thing standing between the cost book and the public tree
// — into a scheduled red on every unrelated PR. tests/ci-manifest.json already
// ships a `quarantined` bucket ("known-red with a dated reason, not run"), so
// the cheapest response to that red is one line that disables all ~100
// assertions here, including the tree-wide sweep. A countdown on the guard is
// not a forcing function; it is a countdown on the guard. The deadline belongs
// where Jo plans from — documentation/projects/WEEKLY_CADENCE.md and the
// handoff brief — and this file's job is to make sure that when the work IS
// done, saying so is one paste, and that nothing here claims it was done until
// somebody does.
//
// WHAT DOES FIRE, and it is the only repo-observable event that matters here:
// a line item being REPRICED while a rotation claim stands. That is the innocuous
// PR — "update the catalog to current pricing" — that silently re-publishes the
// actuals and un-stales a rotated baseline. Measured across the entire history
// of all three catalogs (24 commits: two refactors, a security strip, the TAMKO
// preset, two warranty-accuracy corrections, the county-permit unification, the
// globals tranche, the crew-productivity migration): items were ADDED 9 times
// and REMOVED 3 times, and an existing key's published cost value was repriced
// exactly ZERO times. So composition change is reported, never failed, and the
// repricing check has a measured false-positive rate of zero over the whole
// history — which is what stops it being loosened by the next person the way a
// syntax-pinned guard was on 2026-08-19.
