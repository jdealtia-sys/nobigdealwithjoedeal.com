/* portal-photo-self-announce-2026-09-16.test.js
 *
 * A 2026-09-08 recon flagged: "homeowner's own photo upload gets announced
 * back to them as 'new photo from your rep'." Re-verified live: still true.
 *
 * Root cause: uploadHomeownerPhoto writes the homeowner's own submission
 * into the SAME sharedWithHomeowner-gated photos array the gallery reads,
 * and the live-update diff compared bare photo-count (prev.length vs
 * next.length) with no idea which photo was added or who added it. Every
 * self-upload silently misattributed itself as a rep action within one
 * 30s poll cycle.
 *
 * Two-part fix, tested together since patching only one half is a no-op:
 *   1. functions/portal.js's getHomeownerPortalView now sends `source` on
 *      each photo ('homeowner' | 'rep') — previously stripped along with
 *      the other internal-only fields.
 *   2. docs/pro/js/portal.js's _diffView now diffs photos by id (not bare
 *      length) and excludes source:'homeowner' entries before deciding
 *      whether to fire the "from your rep" banner.
 *
 * Same house style as portal-scheduled-date.test.js: vm-lift the pure
 * function, run direct scenario assertions (no browser/emulator needed for
 * the client half), and regex-assert the server half's shape against raw
 * source text.
