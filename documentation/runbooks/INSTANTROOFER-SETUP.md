# Instant Roofer setup (2026-09-06)

Wiring for [instantroofer.com](https://www.instantroofer.com/instant-roofer-api/) —
AI roof measurement from a coordinate pair (synchronous, 10–20 s) plus a
Human Certified Measure Report (~60 min, drawn by their team, delivered as a
file URL by webhook). It is the **first measurement provider that has ever
had a real key**: HOVER, EagleView and Nearmap were wired in April, but all
three prod secrets are the deploy's `__unset__` stub (verified via Secret
Manager version metadata — one version each, created 2026-04-14 03:25:06/09/12,
three seconds apart, i.e. the stub loop), so every click on the CRM's
auto-measure and D2D "order roof report" buttons had returned "not
configured" for five months.

| Surface | Code | Turn on with |
|---|---|---|
| V2 builder "📐 Auto-measure" | `docs/pro/js/estimate-v2-ui.js` → `autoMeasure` → `NBDIntegrations.requestMeasurement` → `requestMeasurement` (`functions/integrations/measurement.js` → `requestInstantRoofer`) | `INSTANTROOFER_API_KEY` set + a functions deploy |
| D2D "📐 Order precise roof report" | `docs/pro/js/d2d-tracker-core-2026b.js` → `orderRoofReport` (sends the knock pin as lat/lng) | same |
| Human Certified Report (`reportType:'human'`) — **server-side only today, no button** | `requestMeasurement({ reportType:'human' })` → `measurementWebhook?provider=instantroofer` | `INSTANTROOFER_WEBHOOK_SECRET` + the dashboard webhook (§3) |
| **Public estimate leads, measured automatically** | `measureNewWebLead` (`functions/integrations/public-measure.js`) → the wizard reads it back through `publicRoofMeasure` | on by default once the key is set — see §4 to cap or stop it |

The pure logic (request body, response normalizer, error table, webhook
parser, bearer check) is `functions/integrations/instantroofer-logic.js`;
`tests/instantroofer-measurement.test.js` pins it against the vendor's
documented example response.

## 1. Two accounts — only the second one has the key

- **dashboard.instantroofer.com** is the contractor bundle (CRM, quoting,
  website widgets, "$199/mo AI Bundle" with a 7-day unlimited-AI trial). Jo
  signed up here first. It does **not** issue an API key; its "Roof Data
  API" card just links to the marketing page.
- **api-dashboard.instantroofer.com** is the API account: phone-number
  login (SMS code + Cloudflare check), a service agreement to sign, a card
  on file (billed weekly on Sundays), and on activation **10 free AI
  measurements + 1 free Human Certified Report** (credits never expire and
  are consumed before paid usage). Account limits as shown on its
  dashboard: **5 requests/minute, 100 requests/day** — ask Support to raise.

Jo did both on 2026-09-06; the API key is active.

## 2. The key — Jo does this, never into chat, the repo, or `docs/`

The dashboard shows the key once at signup and tells you to **regenerate it
before first use** (banner: "For security, go to API Key and regenerate").
Do that, copy the new value, then:

```bash
firebase functions:secrets:set INSTANTROOFER_API_KEY --project nobigdeal-pro
```

(It prompts for the value — paste there.) **A new secret version binds only
on the next functions deploy** — and only for the functions that are actually
redeployed, because each one reads the value from its own runtime env. Three
functions read these secrets: `requestMeasurement`, `measurementWebhook` and
`integrationStatus` (the admin readout you verify with — a deploy that omits it
keeps reporting the old state). Set the secret *before* merging the PR that
carries this runbook and the full merge deploy binds all three; if it lands
after, run the deploy workflow with `scope=functions`, or at minimum
`npx firebase-tools deploy --only functions:requestMeasurement,functions:measurementWebhook,functions:integrationStatus --project nobigdeal-pro --force`.
Verify with the admin readout (`integrationStatus` → `configured.instantroofer`),
not with a green run.

`NBD_MEASUREMENT_PROVIDER` is not set anywhere, so the code default applies —
and that default is now `instantroofer` (`functions/integrations/_shared.js`).
To go back: `NBD_MEASUREMENT_PROVIDER=hover` in `functions/.env.nobigdeal-pro`
(public repo — provider *names* only, never keys).

## 3. Human-report webhook (needed before any `reportType:'human'` order)

Their dashboard refuses a human order without a webhook destination, and
the code refuses too (`failed-precondition`) unless
`INSTANTROOFER_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set — a $10 report we could never receive
is $10 for nothing. Webhooks are **per report format** (CSV / PDF / HTML /
XML); one completed report fires one delivery per enabled format, and
retries redeliver, so the receiver merges `reportUrls.{format}` idempotently
and keeps the PDF as the headline `measurements.reportUrl`.

API dashboard → **Webhook Delivery** → **PDF Webhook** (and CSV if you want
the data file too):

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Enabled | ✓ |
| Webhook URL | `https://us-central1-nobigdeal-pro.cloudfunctions.net/measurementWebhook?provider=instantroofer` |
| Timeout (seconds) | `15` (our function's own timeout) |
| Bearer token | click **↻ generate**, then **copy** — this is the value of `INSTANTROOFER_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |
| Auth header name | `Authorization` (default) |
| Additional headers | leave empty |

Payload fields (`+ Add row`, key → dynamic value) — the receiver
(`parseHumanWebhook`) reads these names and the snake_case originals, and
accepts `status` as either the string or the numeric `order.status_code`:

| Key | Dynamic value |
|---|---|
| `requestId` | `order.request_id` ← **required**, it is our `externalJobId` |
| `humanReportId` | `order.id` |
| `status` | `order.status` |
| `statusCode` | `order.status_code` |
| `reportType` | `report.type` |
| `reportUrl` | `report.url` |
| `failureReason` | `order.failure_reason` |
| `latitude` | `order.latitude` |
| `longitude` | `order.longitude` |
| `originalAddress` | `order.original_address` |

Then:

```bash
firebase functions:secrets:set INSTANTROOFER_WEBHOOK_SECRET --project nobigdeal-pro
```

The receiver compares `Authorization: Bearer <token>` constant-time, fails
closed with **503** when the secret is unset and **401** on a mismatch
(same shape as the HOVER/EagleView HMAC path). What arrives is a **file
URL only** — the payload never carries numbers. Turning the CSV into
ridge/hip/valley/eave/rake linear feet is a follow-up (see the session
note). The URL lands on the measurement doc as `reportUrls.{format}` and
`measurements.reportUrl`, which the D2D card renders as "Open PDF" — but
**nothing in the CRM orders a human report yet**: no button passes
`reportType:'human'`, so today it is reachable only by calling
`requestMeasurement` directly. Adding that control is the follow-up; this
section makes the receive path ready. Set the secret even if you are not
ordering reports yet — the callable refuses `reportType:'human'` without it,
and this form is the only place the token is ever shown.

## 4. Automated measurement of public leads — the only unattended spend

When a homeowner finishes the `/estimate` wizard, the CRM lead that gets
bridged from their submission is measured automatically. **This is the only
place in the codebase that buys something with no human in the loop**, so it is
fenced four ways:

| Guard | Where | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Gate | `measureNewWebLead` | Fires only for `webLead === true` + `publicLeadKind === 'estimate'` + usable `lat`/`lng`. A CRM-entered, Thumbtack or contact-form lead never measures. |
| Once per lead | deterministic doc id `measurements/weblead-{leadId}` written with `create()` | A Firestore trigger is at-least-once; a redelivery hits `ALREADY_EXISTS` instead of buying a second report. |
| Reuse | the same 90-day `coordKey` cache the rep path uses | A repeat submission for a roof already measured costs nothing. |
| Daily cap | `trigger:measureNewWebLead:daily`, 25/day account-wide | Real volume is ≈1 web lead/day, so this is ~25× headroom and caps a runaway (bot flood, trigger bug) at $75/day rather than unbounded. Deliberately NOT the rep-facing 5/min meter — a storm-day burst of web leads must not resource-exhaust the rep standing on a roof pressing Auto-measure. |

**To stop it without a deploy** (the SPEND_KILLSWITCH pattern — one Firestore
write):

```
feature_flags/global  →  webLeadMeasureDisabled: true
```

The trigger reads that through `integrations/killswitch.js` (60-second cache,
fail-open on a Firestore blip) and logs a WARNING each time it skips. Its
sibling `aiDisabled` is unaffected — measurement is metered vendor budget, not
AI tokens, and an operator may well want to stop one and not the other.

**What the homeowner sees.** The wizard's step-4 ballpark is unchanged and
still free — no vendor call happens for anonymous traffic, which matters
because the public funnel has no CAPTCHA today (§Other caveats). Only after
step 5 captures a name, an SMS-verified phone and an email does the reveal use
real numbers: `publicRoofMeasure` (read-only, spends nothing) hands back
`{sqft, squares, pitch, stories, complexity, confidence}` and the estimate is
recomputed from real squares × NBD's per-square ranges. The model is still
asked for Joe's note, but **never for the arithmetic** — a hallucinated square
count cannot reach a homeowner. A low-confidence measurement adds a visible
caveat, and the ToS attribution ("Roof measurement powered by Instant Roofer")
ships in the same block.

**What Joe sees.** The kanban chip carries the numbers — `📐 38.7 sq · 5/12`
instead of a bare `📐 Measurement` — plus the usual task and activity entry.
The chip is built from numbers only and re-validated against a numeric pattern
before it is printed, because the card renderer has no HTML escaper in scope.

**If it ever looks wrong, check the coordinates first.** They come from the
wizard's Nominatim geocode, which the homeowner then confirms on a zoom-19
satellite view at step 2 ("Is this your home?") — a real human confirmation of
the point, which is better than the rep-facing path gets. But OSM is
street-interpolated where it lacks a building footprint, so a measurement can
still land on the neighbour's roof. The lead records `coordSource` /
`coordPrecision` so this is diagnosable rather than mysterious.

## Cost model — why the code is stingy

| Call | Vendor price (2026-09-06) | Our guard |
|---|---|---|
| AI measure | $3 (0–199/mo), $2 (200–999), $1 (1,000+); 10 free credits first | 20/hr per uid; **5/min account meter** (their published limit); **90-day reuse** — a ready measurement under the same 5-decimal coordinate key, same tenant, is *copied* into a new doc for the caller (`reusedFrom`, `billed:false`) instead of re-billed. **Billed through to the homeowner at $75** like any other measurement (Jo, 2026-09-06) |
| Human Certified Report | $10 on completion; 1 free credit first | refused without the webhook secret; vendor 409s a duplicate for the same coordinates inside their window; pass-through eligible |
| 404 "roof not found" / 422 "too large or irregular" | unknown whether billed — **check Billing after the first one** | the error message tells the rep to put the pin on the building |

Weekly invoice every Sunday against the card on file; the Billing page
shows the tier counters live.

## The $75 pass-through line — and why its wording is load-bearing

Every measurement adds a `SVC MEASURE-RPT` pass-through line to the quote at
`window.NBD_MEASUREMENT_PASSTHRU_PRICE` (default $75). Changed 2026-09-06 at
Jo's direction: AI measures used to be excluded on the reasoning that a $3
internal cost with no deliverable should not be billed. They are billed now —
the measurement is work performed for the customer whether or not paper
changes hands.

**What did NOT change is that the line must describe what the customer
actually gets.** The server sets `passThruHasDocument` and the V2 builder picks
the wording from it:

| Source | `passThruHasDocument` | Line reads |
|---|---|---|
| HOVER / EagleView PDF, Instant Roofer **Human Certified Report** | `true` | **Aerial measurement report** |
| Instant Roofer **AI measure** (incl. a 90-day reuse copy, and web-lead auto-measures) | `false` | **Aerial roof measurement** |

The distinction is not cosmetic. An AI measure produces no document; billing it
as a *report* would put a line on an invoice for something that does not exist
and cannot be produced if the homeowner asks to see it. Same price, honest
description. If someone later "tidies" the two strings into one, that is the
thing they have broken — `tests/instantroofer-measurement.test.js` pins both
the wording and the reasoning comment.

## What the numbers mean (do not double-apply waste)

- `rawSqft` = the vendor's `sqft.measured` — footprint with the predominant
  pitch applied, i.e. the roof surface. **No waste.** The V2 builder and the
  D2D card add their own waste on top, exactly as they did for HOVER's
  `total_facets_area_sqft`.
- `suggestedSqft` / `squares` = the vendor's material figure *with* waste,
  kept for comparison only.
- `pitch` is the predominant pitch as `"5/12"`; `complexity` 0–3 (Low /
  Moderate / High / Extreme); `wastePct` from `buildingPredictions.complexityWaste`
  (read as a fraction when ≤ 1); `confidence.{score,label}` — their buckets are
  Low < 0.24, Medium 0.24–0.34, High ≥ 0.35; `stories` is a beta field.
- The AI response has **no ridge / hip / valley / eave / rake** — only the
  human report (as a file) does. Their API V3 announcement (seen in the
  dashboard 2026-09-06) adds eave/rake/ridge/valley/sidewall/headwall
  lengths and roof height, each with a confidence score, and **discontinues
  raw LiDAR point data immediately** — the adapter already ignores it.

## Coordinates — the part that bites

The API takes **only** `latitude`/`longitude` and returns 404 unless the
point is on the building. `requestMeasurement` resolves them in this order
and records `coordSource` / `coordPrecision` on the doc:

1. `lat`/`lng` from the caller — the D2D knock pin, or (later) the public
   wizard's geocode;
2. the lead: `lead.lat/lng` (CRM Nominatim at save time), then
   `lead.parcel.center` (Regrid parcel centroid);
3. server geocode: Google (ROOFTOP results only) → Regrid → Nominatim. In
   prod today only Nominatim is live — `GOOGLE_GEOCODING_API_KEY` and
   `REGRID_API_TOKEN` are also the April stub — and Nominatim is
   street-interpolated wherever OSM lacks the building footprint, so the V2
   status line says so and asks the rep to confirm the pin. Results are
   cached in `geocode_cache/`.

Bridged web leads and Thumbtack leads carry **no** coordinates (the public
form allowlist drops the wizard's `lat`/`lon`; `lead-bridge-logic` copies
none) — those fall through to step 3.

## First-use verification — DONE 2026-09-06

One live AI measure was run against **their own documentation example
coordinates** (32.865378, -111.677416 — deliberately not a customer's house),
using the real key. `HTTP 200`, 1,536 bytes. What it settled:

| Open question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Does the key work end to end? | Yes — 200 with a full measurement |
| Is `resultOptions` with explicit `false` accepted? | Yes, **and it works**: `imagery` came back empty and `lidar` carried only `facets` — the base64 image and the LiDAR point cloud never reach Firestore |
| Is `complexityWaste` a fraction or a percent? | **A percent** (`11`). The tolerant read lands on 11 either way; do not narrow it on one sample |
| Undocumented fields? | A top-level `coordinates` echo of the point actually measured — useful for confirming we measured the right building. Rides along in `vendorResponse` |
| Confidence shape | `score: 0.408` with `display.value: "High"` — matches the documented ≥0.35 bucket |

The normalizer's output on that live body was correct in every field.

**Still unverified — the human-report webhook `status` shape** (string
`"completed"` vs the numeric `order.status_code`). No human report has been
ordered yet, so both branches stay. When the first one lands, read the doc's
`vendorResponse` / the Cloud Logging entry and prune `parseHumanWebhook`.

## Other caveats
- **Reps vs admins (pre-existing)**: `integrationStatus` is admin-only, so
  the V2 builder's Auto-measure gate reports "not set up" to ordinary reps;
  the D2D button calls the callable directly and works for everyone.
- **ToS**: "Powered by Instant Roofer" must appear on every *visible,
  indexable* page using their technology. Nothing public uses it yet (the
  CRM is authenticated; `privacy.html` only discloses them as a
  sub-processor). The public-wizard slice must add the mark.
- **Found in passing**: `TURNSTILE_SECRET` is the April stub too, so
  `submitPublicLead` is IP-rate-limit-only today. Fix before the wizard
  slice exposes a $3 call to anonymous traffic.
- `measurements/{jobId}` rules are uid-scoped; the 90-day reuse copies the
  doc under the caller's uid precisely so a colleague's job stays readable.
