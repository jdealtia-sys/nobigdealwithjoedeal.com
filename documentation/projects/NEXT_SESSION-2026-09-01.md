## State of the world

**22 PRs merged across the 08-31 → 09-01 run** (#1301–#1320, #1325, #1326),
several of them from background sessions working in parallel.

- **/our-work: 44 live projects, 37 priced.**
- **Marketing is fully caught up** and was the biggest surprise of the run —
  see [POSTING-LOG](../marketing/POSTING-LOG.md). The whole 08-28 kit shipped
  (4 GBP posts + 2 Facebook, the FB page's first posts ever), every unreplied
  Google review was answered, the service area was fixed at the 20-area cap,
  and the photo gallery got its first refresh in 147 days.
- **Rock 2** — the wizard-deletion gate was proven *unobservable* and fixed
  (#1303). The real 30-day Sentry clock runs to **~2026-09-30**. Both Jo
  decisions are recorded: pre-V2 docs stay READ-ONLY, legacy snapshot
  refreshed. Nothing to do but check Sentry weekly.
- **Rock 4 Tranche 3** — moving fast: **T3-0 ✅** (#1316), **T3-A slice 1 ✅**
  (#1319, 86 inert re-exports deleted), **T3-M ✅** (#1326), plus a wiring
  test (#1320).
- **The `_admin` migration is DONE** — all six scripts ported (#1318, #1325,
  **#1329**), with a real bug fixed along the way. `scripts/` now holds zero
  legacy-namespace calls and `tests/smoke/functions.test.js` fails if one comes
  back. The last `NODE_PATH` override in CI is gone too (**#1330**). See
  [ADMIN-SCRIPTS-COST-IMPORT-PORT-2026-09-01](../audit/ADMIN-SCRIPTS-COST-IMPORT-PORT-2026-09-01.md).

## Lanes, in priority order

1. **Rock 4 Tranche 3 — keep going.**
   [globals-tranche3-plan](../../docs/dev/globals-tranche3-plan.md) is the
   map and it is being kept current as slices land.

   **Do not start from "the rest of T3-A (~2 more mechanical PRs)".** Slice 1
   disproved that framing and the plan now carries a ⚠ CORRECTION block saying
   so: of the 34 candidate names the census produced for `dashboard-actions.js`,
   **zero were mechanically safe** and 26 were not even owned by that file. The
   filter behind the "277 mechanically-safe" band cannot see bare cross-file
   calls or `window[fnName]` map dispatch, so its output is a starting list, not
   a work list. Re-derive any T3-A slice with a checker that tests both — see
   [SESSION-2026-08-31-t3-a-slice1](SESSION-2026-08-31-t3-a-slice1.md).

   **The concrete next work is the 15 names T3-M just unblocked.** Making the
   two dispatch maps registry-first freed 17 of their 36 names; 2 landed with
   that slice, and the other 15 are grouped by owning file, one slice each:
   `dashboard-ui.js` (8), `maps-routing.js` (6), `crm-portal-bridge.js` (1).
   Each is measured, not estimated — the map is their only reach. Expect real
   work rather than a one-line move: they are top-level auto-globals, so
   converting them means IIFE-wrapping regions of large files.

   After that: **T3-B** (177 names with HTML hits or twin assigners), **T3-C**
   (176 one-consumer by edge, ~5–6 PRs), **T3-D** (the 131-name 2–5 band →
   NBD-prefixed singleton APIs), **T3-E** (docs-only spine disposition, half a
   session).

   Re-run `node scripts/globals-xref.js` before trusting any number in the plan
   — that habit already caught a 4× overestimate once. **But the census alone is
   not enough**: it reproduces the plan's numbers exactly and still missed all
   three defects slice 1 found. When a slice is defined by a tool's output,
   audit the tool before executing the slice.

2. **Dependabot — two merged, two awaiting a rebase.** #1321 (setup-java)
   and #1322 (firebase) went in green on 09-01. Merging those two moved
   `tests/package-lock.json`, which put **#1323** (firebase-tools) and
   **#1324** (playwright) into CONFLICTING/DIRTY. `@dependabot rebase` has
   been requested on both — they should come back clean on their own; merge
   on green. Do **not** hand-resolve the lockfile (see the standing rule
   about `proxy-agent-negotiate` drift). If a future sweep has several
   dependabot PRs touching the same lockfile, merge one and rebase the rest
   rather than firing them all at once.

3. ~~**Finish the `_admin` migration**~~ — **DONE, #1329.** Both scripts
   ported; the migration is complete. The framing above held up: they resolved
   fine and died at first use of the namespace, and they really do write a
   server timestamp — but that turned out to cost nothing, because v14 removed
   the *accessor*, not the class (v12's `admin.firestore.FieldValue` is `===`
   the modular one, `toProto` is byte-identical, and a v12 and a v14 write read
   back as the same `Timestamp`). Nothing in the repo reads either field.

4. ~~**`.github/workflows/address-audit.yml` pins firebase-admin@12 via
   `NODE_PATH`**~~ — **DONE, #1330.** Confirmed by a `workflow_dispatch` run
   that read prod on 14.3.0 and passed. Note the fix was *not* deleting the
   `NODE_PATH` line: the workflow never installed `functions/` deps at all, so
   that alone would have left `_admin`'s fallback with nothing to resolve to
   and killed the next scheduled run with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.

> **Two findings from #1329 worth carrying forward, both the kind that make a
> check stop meaning anything:**
>
> - **A dry run on those two importers verifies nothing.** They exit above the
>   firebase-admin require, so `--dry-run` never loads `_admin`, never
>   authenticates and never reaches Firestore (proved with a loader spy). Use
>   the Firestore emulator to exercise an admin script's write path — it is
>   cheap, and it is the only thing short of a prod write that proves anything.
> - **Check that a negative control actually ran.** The first one here patched
>   sources with `python`, which is not installed on this machine; every patch
>   silently no-opped and all five cases printed `exit=0` — a control that
>   "passed" while testing nothing. Make the patcher fail loudly on a missing
>   anchor.

## Marketing — what the 08-31 run learned

**Photos out-reach posts on this profile.** Gallery images show 188, 308 and
**one past 1,000 views** — more than a typical post earns, on the surface
that had been neglected for 147 days. Start the next marketing session with
photos, not copy.

The biggest open gap costs nothing: **no photo on the profile shows a human
face.** For a brand built on "Talk to Joe — not a salesman," that is the
single best fix available, and `docs/assets/images/joe-hero.jpg` is already
in the repo. Six more gaps are listed in POSTING-LOG.

**Two constraints, so no future handoff assigns impossible work:** Jo drives
an **unbranded work wagon and has no magnets**, so "photograph your truck
door" is not available. And the **storefront slot does not apply** to a
service-area business — Profile Strength may never read full. Do not upload
a customer's house to satisfy it.

## Held content (Jo's calls, no agent action)

- **Sharon Batavia / Southman** — the siding-replacement strip is still
  empty and unfillable from Drive (settled 08-28, do not re-run that search).
  Live path is the Southman proposal (NBD-2026-0811-STH Option B, $4,600); if
  Jo closes it, document as it happens.
- **Review authenticity** — the 7–18-week review cluster has hallmarks of
  purchased reviews (one describes a *plumbing* job; one account is an Indian
  engineering college). Jo states they are genuine; replies went out on his
  instruction, deliberately worded to claim nothing. Recorded in POSTING-LOG
  because a fake-review purge can suspend an entire profile.

## Watch-outs

- **`main` is held by a worktree** at `C:/Users/jonat/nbd-wt-ledger-recon` —
  branch from `origin/main`, never check out `main` in the primary checkout.
- **Three `.claude/worktrees` are live.** Removing one deletes THROUGH a
  node_modules junction — gated procedure, see the 08-26 session note.
- **Two branches are deliberately kept**: `chore/stripe-pin-harden` carries
  an explicit `[DO NOT MERGE w/o test-mode verify]`, and
  `claude/silly-archimedes-2eabef` is now redundant (its work shipped as
  #1318) but is held by a worktree.
- **The 08-28 photo scratchpad was preserved** to
  `C:\Users\jonat\NBD-photo-staging-2026-08-31` (1.7 GB) before Windows temp
  could evaporate it. EXIF-bearing originals — never commit or publish
  directly.
- **Verify before trusting a docstring.** This run disproved two: the
  "v14 breaks Timestamps" line that had copy-pasted itself into seven
  scripts, and the `NODE_PATH` remedy that turned out to cause the very
  problem it warned about.
