# Session 2026-08-31 — weekly sweep, two rocks advanced, four cards published

> Power session with Jo live. Five PRs merged to main: #1301 + #1302
> (dependabot), #1303 (Rock 2 telemetry fix), #1304 (Rock 4 Tranche 3
> plan), #1305 (four /our-work cards, 39 → 43). Two multi-agent
> verification workflows ran (6 agents total); both caught things a
> single pass had missed.

## Weekly sweep (Monday cadence) — all green

All 8 local gates clean at baseline. Main CI quiet since 08-26; the two
visible reds were both already-diagnosed (the #1276 deploy transient fixed
by #1278, and the Lead address audit correctly failing on Jo's 4 records).
Dependabot #1301 (44 non-major functions bumps) and #1302 (protobufjs)
merged 19/19 green; #1301's functions deploy completed success. Stray
`nul` file removed from the repo root.

## Rock 2 — the wizard-deletion gate was UNOBSERVABLE; fixed (#1303)

The standing gate ("zero `[estimates.js DEPRECATED]` warns in the prod
log") could never fire: Sentry has no console-capture integration, so a
solo `console.warn` only ever rode along as a breadcrumb on unrelated
*error* events, and no other client log sink exists (`/cspReport` is the
only monitoring HTTP endpoint). "Zero warns observed" was vacuous truth.

Fix: `_warnDeprecatedOnce` now also ships `Sentry.captureMessage(msg,
'warning')` — once per page load per function, only when a deprecated path
runs. **The 30-day zero-warn clock starts at #1303's deploy date
(2026-08-31).** Where to look: Sentry → Issues → `estimates.js
DEPRECATED`. Full mechanics + a reachability nuance (the chooser is also
reachable via estimate-entry.js's V2-missing fallback, so a warn burst
during a deploy window is the fallback, not real usage):
[estimate-engines-audit §2026-08-31](../../docs/dev/estimate-engines-audit.md).

Still needed from Jo before final deletion (unanswered this session):
pre-V2 stored docs — migrate vs read-only; and whether to refresh the
`dashboard.legacy.html` rollback snapshot.

## Rock 4 — Tranche 3 dependency-ordered plan written (#1304)

[globals-tranche3-plan](../../docs/dev/globals-tranche3-plan.md), census
reproducible via the committed `scripts/globals-xref.js`. Headline: the
July "~515 middle band" estimate conflated xref rows with names — the real
2–5-consumer band is **131 names**. 827 assigned globals total: 454
zero-external (277 mechanically safe), 176 one-consumer (6 clean
file-edges), 66 spine — the spine is mostly keep-as-API (Firebase compat
re-exports, `_leads`/`_user` state, `goTo`, house singletons), explicitly
listed so nobody re-audits it. Slice order: T3-0 (shim-blocked residual
first) → T3-A mechanical → T3-B delegate-then-scope → T3-C edges → T3-D
NBD-prefixed APIs → T3-E docs close.

## Four cards published (#1305) — /our-work 39 → 43, 36 priced

| Card | Town | Price | The story |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kalb siding peak reseal | Loveland | unpriced | The 2026-07-29 "Higgins" frames — Jo named Terri Kalb; EXIF matched the known 13:39–13:47 visit; no invoice exists in Drive or CRM (searched by name + variants), unpriced by evidence not oversight |
| Wilson wind repair 2023 | **Loveland** | unpriced | Jo guessed "amelia?" — the 2023 JKRC customer book (Drive, Scott's sheet) has him at Apache Trail, which is Miami Twp East / ZIP 45140 = Loveland mailing. Published on document + map evidence, Jo signed off |
| Garrity EPDM inspection | Loveland | $100–200 | First flat-roof/EPDM card in the gallery. 5 detail frames picked from ~137 raw against the 13-photo report captions; ponding frame needed a 90° rotation (EXIF orientation stripped) |
| By Golly's commercial rebuild | Milford | $73,000–74,000 | Jo cleared the courtesy call AND naming. Combined retail $73,481.40 = $64,011.90 RCV + the Oct tarp $2,086.50 + re-issued repair $7,383.00 (Jo confirmed same job). Only 2 photos exist for the whole job — both carry baked-in claim-annotation circles, no clean originals anywhere (verified exhaustively 08-28); frame 2 cropped top 10% for a partial crew face |

## Techniques proven this session (reusable)

- **Company customer books resolve towns that job folders can't.** Wilson's
  "no town in ANY document" was true of his JOB folder — but the era's
  customer spreadsheet ("2023 JK Roofing Customers (Scott's only)",
  Drive 17jIeEuuNx…) carries a street per customer, and street → ZIP →
  mailing town finishes the job. The neighbor-township trap is real: Jo's
  own memory said Amelia; the street said Loveland. Same doctrine as
  EXIF-beats-assumption, extended to paperwork.
- **Adversarial re-verify catches what a first QA missed, even a good
  one.** The 08-28 Wilson review was careful and still missed a second
  partial crew face (during-shingle-lift-tools). A fresh agent prompted to
  verify-the-claims found it in one pass. Photo sets touching faces get a
  second independent look before publish, always.
- **Every wide angle on a low flat roof leaks the neighbors.** All three
  refused Garrity frames failed the same way (adjacent houses, yard
  contents, streetscape over the parapet). Flat-roof cards should plan on
  detail shots only.
- **The deprecation-gate lesson generalizes**: before trusting any
  "zero events observed" gate, verify the event CAN reach the sink.
  Absence of evidence needs a live channel to mean anything.

## Jo decisions recorded this session

Kalb = Terri Kalb, Loveland · Garrity = Loveland · Wilson = Loveland
(sign-off on doc evidence over his Amelia guess) · By Golly's courtesy
call cleared, naming approved, Oct invoices same job · merge #1305.

## Still open (all carried to the 08-31 handoff)

GBP/Facebook posting session (kit still deliberately unposted) · Rock 2
side-decisions (above) · Philpot card (TAMKO brand-sensitivity, Jo's
call) · draft PR #1299 (INDEX handoff consolidation — needs rebase over
this session's INDEX edit; finish or close) · Sharon Batavia gutter
frames for the thin gutter page (generic illustration only, never
completion-dated).
