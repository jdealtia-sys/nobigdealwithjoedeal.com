# site-src/partials — shared chrome for the homeowner site

The homeowner pages under `docs/` are hand-maintained standalone HTML, because
`docs/` **is** the Firebase hosting root — what is committed is what ships.
That means every page has historically carried its own copy of the nav, footer
and chrome, and the only way to change one was a regex codemod across 200
files. 23 of the scripts in `scripts/` exist for exactly that, and each pass
left the cohort slightly more forked than it found it. The "— Goshen, OH"
footer that shipped to 139 pages was this failure mode.

This directory holds the single source of truth for that duplicated chrome.

## How it works

A page opts a block in by wrapping it in markers:

```html
<!-- nbd:partial footer-standard crumb_service_href="/services/roof-repair" crumb_service_name="Roof Repair" crumb_city_href="/areas/mason-oh" crumb_city_name="Mason" -->
  ...generated...
<!-- /nbd:partial footer-standard -->
```

`scripts/apply-partials.js` renders `site-src/partials/<name>.html` into every
region, substituting `{{key}}` from the marker's attributes.

```bash
node scripts/apply-partials.js            # restamp drifted regions in place
node scripts/apply-partials.js --check    # write nothing; exit 1 on drift
node scripts/apply-partials.js --check --diff
```

## The workflow

- **Change the chrome everywhere** → edit `site-src/partials/<name>.html`, run
  `node scripts/apply-partials.js`, commit the partial *and* every restamped page.
- **Change one page's values** → edit the attributes on that page's opening marker,
  then run the same command.
- **Never hand-edit inside a region.** It is generated; the next run overwrites it,
  and CI fails in the meantime. Page-specific content belongs outside the markers.

## Why per-page values live on the marker, not in a manifest

The location pages are authored by copying a sibling and renaming it. A
manifest keyed by path silently orphans its entry when that happens, whereas
marker attributes travel with the file. They are also greppable —
`grep -rl 'crumb_city="Mason"' docs/` answers "which pages claim Mason".

## Enforcement

`apply-partials.js --check` runs in two places, and the scheme is only real
because of them:

1. `ci.yml` → **Site integrity** job, on every PR.
2. `firebase-deploy.yml` → the pre-hosting gate, against the tree that actually
   ships. It is `--check` there on purpose: restamping at deploy time would
   publish content that is not in the repo.

The renderer also asserts structural contracts before stamping anything — a
`nav-*` partial must still contain `id="mainNav"` / `id="navLinks"` /
`id="hamburger"`, a footer must still contain `<footer>`. Those IDs are what
the runtime JS binds to, so losing one would ship pages whose controls are
silently dead rather than visibly broken.

## Line endings

The pages are **CRLF**. The renderer works in LF internally and re-emits with
each file's own ending. Do not "fix" this: stamping LF into a CRLF file
rewrites every line of the region and turns every future diff into noise.

## Coverage

Partial coverage is a supported state — the gate only governs regions that
exist, so an unconverted page is a coverage gap, not a failure.

| Partial | Pages | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `footer-standard` | 107 | service+city and the pages sharing that exact footer |

a small job): **24 blog** posts (6,443–6,512 B — the tightest cluster, best next
candidate), **26 area** pages, **28 service** hub/plain pages, 5 root pages,
